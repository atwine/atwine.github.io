# LMIC Healthcare AI Consulting Launch Plan
## 90-Day Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

---

# WEEK 1: FOUNDATION & POSITIONING

## Day 1-2: Brand Positioning & Messaging
### ‚úÖ Task 1: Define Your Unique Value Proposition
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Write your one-liner: "I help healthcare organizations implement AI that actually works in low-resource settings"
- [ ] List 5 specific LMIC challenges you've solved (infrastructure, data scarcity, budget constraints, etc.)
- [ ] Document your differentiator: "Real deployments in Uganda, not theoretical consulting"

**üß† Strategic Thinking Notes:**
*Drawing from your UVRI/ACE experience - you've actually built systems that work in Uganda's infrastructure reality. Most consultants talk theory; you have deployment scars.*

**‚ùì Implementation Questions:**
- What specific infrastructure challenges did you overcome at UVRI that Western consultants wouldn't know about?
- How do you quantify the difference between your "works in practice" vs. competitors' "works in theory"?
- Which of your 5+ years of failures taught you the most about what NOT to do in LMIC settings?
- How can you frame your eLwazi platform leadership as proof of scalable LMIC AI success?

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Audit Current Materials
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Review your GitHub site against new positioning
- [ ] List what needs to change (services, messaging, case studies)
- [ ] Create content gaps list (missing case studies, testimonials, etc.)

**üß† Strategic Thinking Notes:**
*Your current materials likely focus on technical skills rather than LMIC-specific problem-solving. The shift is from "I can build AI" to "I can make AI work where others fail."*

**‚ùì Implementation Questions:**
- Does your current site mention Uganda, UVRI, or LMIC challenges at all?
- Are you currently positioned as a generalist data scientist or an LMIC specialist?
- What testimonials can you get from colleagues at UVRI/ACE about your practical problem-solving?
- Which projects are you hiding that actually demonstrate your unique value?

## Day 3-4: Service Package Definition
### ‚úÖ Task 3: Define Your Service Offerings
**Create detailed descriptions for:**

**Package 1: Healthcare AI Feasibility Assessment ($3,500)**
- [ ] 2-week timeline
- [ ] Deliverable: Infrastructure readiness report
- [ ] Deliverable: Technology recommendations for low-resource settings
- [ ] Deliverable: Implementation roadmap with budget constraints

**Package 2: LMIC-Ready AI Implementation ($15,000-35,000)**
- [ ] 8-12 week timeline
- [ ] Deliverable: Offline-capable AI system
- [ ] Deliverable: Training materials for local staff
- [ ] Deliverable: Maintenance documentation

**Package 3: AI Sustainability Framework ($8,000)**
- [ ] 6-week timeline
- [ ] Deliverable: Long-term maintenance plan
- [ ] Deliverable: Local capacity building program
- [ ] Deliverable: Cost-effective scaling strategy

**üß† Strategic Thinking Notes:**
*These prices reflect your unique positioning - you're not competing on price with Indian outsourcers, but on "actually works in LMIC settings." Your eLwazi platform experience proves you can deliver Package 2 successfully.*

**‚ùì Implementation Questions:**
- What specific infrastructure assessment checklist did you develop from your UVRI experience?
- How do you demonstrate ROI when clients are budget-constrained? (Reference your ACE multi-project experience)
- What's your "failure rate" story - how many Western AI solutions fail in LMIC settings vs. yours?
- Can you create a "sustainability scorecard" based on what you learned from managing 5+ member teams at UVRI?

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Create Service Descriptions
**For each package, write:**
- [ ] Problem statement (what LMIC challenge it solves)
- [ ] Solution overview (how you solve it differently)
- [ ] Deliverables (specific outputs)
- [ ] Timeline and pricing
- [ ] Why you're uniquely qualified to deliver it

## Day 5-7: Case Study Development
### ‚úÖ Task 5: Document Your Proven Implementations
**Case Study 1: COVID Decision Support System (IDI)**
- [ ] Problem: Need for COVID guidance system with limited infrastructure
- [ ] Solution: Offline-capable chatbot with low bandwidth requirements
- [ ] Results: Successful deployment across health facilities
- [ ] Lessons: What worked, what didn't, adaptations made

**Case Study 2: HIV Risk Prediction with Limited Data**
- [ ] Problem: Building predictive models with sparse datasets
- [ ] Solution: Data harmonization and innovative modeling techniques
- [ ] Results: Actionable insights for targeted interventions
- [ ] Lessons: How to work with incomplete data in LMIC settings

**Case Study 3: eLwazi Data Infrastructure (UVRI)**
- [ ] Problem: Creating data science platform in resource-constrained environment
- [ ] Solution: FAIR-compliant system designed for local constraints
- [ ] Results: Functional data platform supporting research
- [ ] Lessons: Infrastructure challenges and solutions

**üß† Strategic Thinking Notes:**
*These case studies are GOLD - they show actual deployments in Uganda, not pilot projects. Your CV shows you led teams and managed complex integration challenges that most consultants never face.*

**‚ùì Implementation Questions:**
- What specific metrics can you share? (Users reached, uptime achieved, cost savings delivered?)
- What would have happened if a Western consultant tried to implement these same solutions?
- How do you frame your "learning from failure" stories as competitive advantages?
- Which stakeholders from these projects can provide testimonials about your unique problem-solving approach?
- What technical details should you include vs. keep high-level for business audiences?

### ‚úÖ Task 6: Case Study Format
**For each case study, create:**
- [ ] 2-page detailed version (for proposals)
- [ ] 1-page summary (for website)
- [ ] LinkedIn post version (for social media)
- [ ] Key metrics and outcomes

- [ ] Social proof: "Trusted by UVRI, IDI, and ACE"
- [ ] Call-to-action: "Free 30-minute LMIC AI feasibility consultation"

**üß† Strategic Thinking Notes:**
*Your homepage needs to immediately communicate "I've been there, I've built this, I know what actually works." Most AI consultants show Silicon Valley success stories - you show Kampala success stories.*

**‚ùì Implementation Questions:**
- What visual proof can you show? (Photos from Uganda, screenshots of working systems, team photos from UVRI?)
- How do you quantify "actually works" - uptime stats, user adoption, cost effectiveness?
- What's your "elevator pitch" version of why LMIC AI is different from Western AI?
- Should you include a "failure rate" stat comparing Western solutions vs. yours in LMIC settings?

# SUCCESS METRICS & TRACKING

## Weekly Metrics to Track:
- [ ] **Outreach**: Number of new contacts made
- [ ] **Content**: Posts published, engagement rates
- [ ] **Pipeline**: New leads, discovery calls, proposals sent
- [ ] **Network**: New connections, referrals received
- [ ] **Revenue**: Proposals won, revenue generated

**üß† Strategic Thinking Notes:**
*Track quality over quantity - one qualified LMIC AI prospect is worth 10 generic data science leads. Your metrics should reflect your premium positioning.*

**‚ùì Implementation Questions:**
- How do you distinguish between LMIC-qualified leads vs. generic AI interest?
- What engagement metrics indicate genuine LMIC implementation challenges vs. theoretical interest?
- Which content pieces generate the highest-quality prospect engagement?
- How do you measure relationship strength vs. just connection count?
- What early warning indicators suggest a prospect has unrealistic expectations about LMIC AI deployment?

## Monthly Review Questions:
- [ ] What's working best for lead generation?
- [ ] Which content pieces drive most engagement?
- [ ] What objections am I hearing most often?
- [ ] How can I improve my conversion rates?
- [ ] What partnerships should I prioritize?

## 90-Day Success Targets:
- [ ] **Network**: 100+ new professional connections
- [ ] **Content**: 12+ blog posts, 36+ LinkedIn posts
- [ ] **Pipeline**: 15+ qualified prospects, 10+ discovery calls
- [ ] **Proposals**: 5+ submitted, 2+ won
- [ ] **Revenue**: $10,000+ in signed contracts

**üß† Strategic Thinking Notes:**
*These targets assume you're building on your existing UVRI/ACE foundation, not starting from zero. Your 5+ years of proven experience should accelerate these timelines.*

**‚ùì Implementation Questions:**
- Given your existing network depth, should you target higher-value prospects with fewer total connections?
- How does your proven track record change the typical consulting sales cycle timeline?
- What's your conversion rate likely to be given your credibility vs. unknown consultants?
- Should you be targeting larger initial contracts based on your demonstrable expertise?
- How do you leverage your existing relationships to fast-track the 90-day timeline?

**üß† Strategic Thinking Notes:**
*With your proven UVRI/ACE track record, if you're not getting clients, it's likely a positioning/messaging issue, not a capability issue. Don't compete on price - compete on "actually works."*

**‚ùì Implementation Questions:**
- What specific messaging isn't resonating with your target market?
- Are you talking to the right decision-makers or getting stuck with technical evaluators?
- Is your pricing aligned with the value of preventing expensive failures?
