### 2. LinkedIn "About" Section (Summary)

This section should be a direct, first-person version of the powerful summary you just wrote. It establishes immediate authority and empathy.

**Suggested Text:**
```
I solve healthcare data problems that others consider "impossible" in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Having proven my expertise in Uganda's resource-constrained health system—from rural clinics to Ministry of Health boardrooms—I bring battle-tested approaches ready to scale across Africa. I've learned that the most sophisticated AI is worthless if it can't run on unreliable power or be understood by overworked healthcare workers.

**How I Deliver Results:**
- **I build end-to-end AI/ML solutions** that enable **Faster Outbreak Response**, detecting disease patterns weeks earlier than traditional surveillance
- **I create integrated data systems** that optimize resource allocation through real-time dashboards showing exactly where to deploy drugs, staff, and supplies
- **I deliver production-ready solutions** that increase program effectiveness by accurately identifying at-risk populations before crises hit
- **I develop local technical capacity** that strengthens funding proposals with hard evidence of measurable health impact

My clients—governments, UN agencies, and research institutions—engage me when they need someone who understands both cutting-edge AI capabilities and the ground reality of implementing solutions where budgets are tight, infrastructure is unreliable, and stakeholder buy-in determines success.

**I don't do:** One-size-fits-all solutions, academic research that never gets deployed, or systems that collapse when international funding ends.

**Core expertise:** Machine learning for epidemiological surveillance, health systems optimization, real-time decision support dashboards, and transforming fragmented health data into evidence-based policy recommendations.

### 3. LinkedIn Experience Section

Each role should be a mini-case study, framed using our "Problem-Solution-Impact" model.

**Role: Data Engineer (AMR Project) | Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) - Lacuna Fund**
```
As the lead data engineer on a nationally significant **$100k Lacuna Fund-awarded project**, I am building the core infrastructure to combat one of public health's greatest threats: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).

**Problem:** Uganda's national health system lacked the high-quality, centralized data needed to develop AI models to fight drug-resistant infections.

**Solution & Impact:** My core responsibility is transforming fragmented clinical records into a robust, AI-ready national dataset. I am building the foundational data pipeline and testing initial ML models, directly enabling the creation of a data warehouse that will accelerate research and inform policy for the Ministry of Health and WHO.
```

**Role: Data Science Specialist | Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI)**
```
As co-lead of the data workstream for the eLwazi Open Data Science Platform—a pan-African consortium of 12 institutions supported by the NIH—I was central to solving a critical challenge: unlocking siloed health data to enable continent-wide research.

**Problem:** Critical health data was locked in institutional silos across Africa, preventing the large-scale research needed to tackle pandemics and genetic diseases.

**Solution & Impact:**

- **Delivered a Continental Data Asset:** Led teams that designed and deployed a centralized data catalog and portals, unlocking siloed datasets from multiple African countries for the first time.
- **Enabled Pan-African Collaborative Research:** Built the foundational infrastructure for continent-wide AI and genomic research by establishing robust metadata standards and data harmonization strategies.
- **Built Sustainable, Localized Infrastructure:** Pioneered the on-site data science infrastructure at UVRI, establishing the local workflows and tools for long-term national participation.

**Role: Team Lead & Natural Language Specialist | African Center of Excellence (HEAL Project)**
```
As team lead for a diverse group of 8 professionals on the HEAL project, I spearheaded the development of an innovative multilingual application to solve a critical problem for frontline health workers. This project was backed by the **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation & Code For Africa**.

**Role: Team Lead & Natural Language Specialist | African Center of Excellence (HEAL Project)**
```
**Problem:** During urgent pandemic situations, frontline health workers were unable to quickly access critical, life-saving guidelines from dense documents, and these materials assumed everyone spoke English. This language barrier created dangerous delays in patient care and introduced bias in application, particularly for those working in local languages.

**Solution & Impact:** As the team lead for a diverse group of 8 professionals on the **HEAL project (backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation & Code For Africa)**, I spearheaded the development of an innovative multilingual application that transformed health guideline access.

- **Led Full-Cycle AI Development:** Guided the team through the entire AI lifecycle, including data curation, sophisticated deep learning workflows, LLM tuning and integration, RAP Application, Seq2Seq Modeling and managing multiple APIs (Hugging Face) for a production-ready solution. 
- **Revolutionized Information Access:** Deployed an application that provided instant, accurate health information in both English and Luganda, substantially reducing information retrieval times in crisis scenarios.
- **Empowered Frontline Health Workers:** The tool directly enabled faster, better-informed clinical decisions, revolutionizing how health guidelines were utilized during urgent pandemic situations.
```

**Solution & Impact:** I led the development of an application that provided instant, accurate health information in both English and Luganda. This tool substantially reduced information retrieval times, empowered faster clinical decisions, and revolutionized how health guidelines were utilized in a crisis.
```

**Role: Lead Data Scientist & COVID-19 Response Lead | Makerere University & Africa Center of Excellence (ACE)**
```
As the team and technical lead for a 7-person team, I directed the full-cycle development of a national AI-powered chatbot to solve a critical communications breakdown during the pandemic.

**Problem:** Health authorities were overwhelmed by 50,000+ daily COVID-19 inquiries while their IVR systems failed, and dangerous misinformation spread rapidly.

**Solution & Impact:** I led the development of a national AI-powered chatbot that provided instant, verified health information to the public.

- **Architected & Deployed a National AI Tool:** Guided the team through technology selection (Rasa), microservices architecture design, and deployment using Docker & Kubernetes (K3s) to handle 15,000+ concurrent users.
- **Automated Critical Communications:** The chatbot processed 200,000+ citizen queries, freeing human resources and ensuring consistent, accurate messaging during peak crisis periods.
- **Built Sustainable Technical Capacity:** Advised on technical frameworks and trained internal teams on AI development processes and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring the project's long-term viability.
```

**Role: Senior Data Scientist & ML Technical Lead | Africa Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics (ACE)**
```
As a consultant for ACE, I led multiple high-impact projects that addressed critical public health challenges through the practical application of data science and AI.

**Key Projects & Impact:**

- **Built Foundational MLOps Infrastructure (RIF Grant):** As the lead technical expert on a Makerere Research Institute Fund (RIF) grant, I established the core data science and ML pipeline capabilities for the center, enabling all subsequent AI project development.

**Role: Principal Project Lead & NLP Specialist | Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI)**
```
As Principal Project Lead, I steered a team of 7 to solve a critical challenge for healthcare providers: the need for effective, real-time decision support in the face of complex data and ethical concerns.

**Problem:** Healthcare providers were hampered by complex data, a lack of production-ready AI pipelines, and concerns over ethical implementation.

**Solution & Impact:** I led the team to design, build, and deploy a full-stack, ethical AI-powered Decision Support System from the ground up, now serving 15+ health facilities.

- **Engineered the Complete ML Lifecycle:** Guided the end-to-end development, from data curation and creating robust Python pipelines to model tuning, CI/CD initiation, and deployment architecture, processing over 10,000 patient records monthly.
