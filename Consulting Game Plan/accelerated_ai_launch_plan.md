## PHASE 1: THE 7-DAY SETUP (Minimum Viable Brand & Offer)

**Goal:** Go from idea to outreach-ready in one week.

### ✅ Day 1-2: Define Your "Foot-in-the-Door" Value Ladder

*Your current plan starts at $3,500. We need a lower barrier to entry to build trust and generate quick wins.*

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **Define the FREE Offer (The Audit):** "Free 30-Minute AI Opportunity Audit for LMIC Health Projects." This is your lead magnet. You will analyze a potential client's project/organization and deliver a 3-point action plan on a single page.
- [ ] **Define the LOW-RISK Offer (The First Paid Project - ~$500-$1,500):** This is the immediate upsell from the free audit. Choose one:
    - **Option A: The "AI Content Multiplier" ($500):** Take one of their existing research papers or reports and turn it into 5 LinkedIn posts, 10 tweets, and a 1-page summary for funders, using AI tools. *This is low effort, high value, and demonstrates immediate ROI.*
    - **Option B: The "Automation Playbook" ($1,000):** Analyze one of their manual administrative processes (e.g., reporting, scheduling) and deliver a step-by-step playbook on how to automate it using no-code AI tools.
    - **Option C: The "Context Engineering Primer" ($1,500):** For a more advanced client, create a structured context document and a set of advanced prompts for one specific, recurring task they perform with LLMs.
- [ ] **Define the CORE Offer (Your Existing Packages):** Your $3.5k+ packages are the next step after you've proven your value with the low-risk offer.

### ✅ Day 3-4: Create Your "One-Page Arsenal"

*Forget a full website for now. You only need two documents.*

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **Create the "One-Page Case Study":** Condense your **eLwazi Data Infrastructure** project into a single, powerful PDF. Structure it using the **Problem-Agitate-Solution** framework.
    - **Problem:** "Creating a robust data science platform in a resource-constrained environment like Uganda is nearly impossible with standard Western solutions."
    - **Agitate:** "This leads to failed projects, wasted funding, and an inability to leverage data for critical health insights."
    - **Solution:** "We built the eLwazi platform, a FAIR-compliant system designed specifically for local infrastructure constraints, which now successfully supports multiple research projects."
    - *Include 1-2 powerful metrics (e.g., uptime, number of users, cost savings vs. a Western alternative).*
- [ ] **Create the "Free Audit" One-Pager:** A simple document explaining what the free audit includes and the value they'll receive (a 3-point action plan).

### ✅ Day 5-7: Build Your "First 20" Prospect List & Outreach Templates

*Hyper-personalization is key. We are targeting a small, highly qualified list.*

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **List 20 "Tier 1" Contacts:** Go through your UVRI, IDI, and ACE network. Identify exactly 20 people who are either direct decision-makers or can introduce you to one. *Do not list more than 20.*
- [ ] **Craft the "Value-First" Email Template:** This email does NOT ask for a meeting. It OFFERS value.
    - **Subject:** "AI idea for [Project Name at their Org]"
    - **Body:** "Hi [Name], hope you're well. I was thinking about the work you're doing on [Project Name] and had an idea for how you could potentially use AI to [achieve a specific outcome, e.g., streamline your reporting].
    
    I'm offering a free 'AI Opportunity Audit' to a few organizations I respect. In 30 minutes, I can give you a 3-point action plan you can implement immediately.
    
    No strings attached. Would you be open to me sending over a one-page summary of what the audit involves?"

## PHASE 2: THE 2-WEEK CLIENT ACQUISITION BLITZ

**Goal:** Deliver value, build trust, and close your first paid project.

### ✅ Day 8-10: Execute Outreach & Book Audits

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Send your personalized, "Value-First" email to your list of 20 prospects.
- [ ] For those who respond positively, send the "Free Audit" one-pager and a scheduling link.
- [ ] **Goal:** Book at least 3-5 free audits.

### ✅ Day 11-20: Deliver Audits & Present the Low-Risk Offer

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Conduct the free 30-minute audits. Your goal is to **over-deliver** with incredible insights.
- [ ] At the end of each audit, after providing the 3-point action plan, make the transition:
    - **The Script:** "You can take these ideas and run with them yourself. However, if you want to see results faster, I have a special introductory offer. For just [Price of your Low-Risk Offer], I can personally [deliver the outcome of your Low-Risk Offer, e.g., 'create all your content for the next month']. This is a great way for us to work together without a large commitment. How does that sound?"
- [ ] Send a simple follow-up email with the audit notes and a link to pay for the low-risk offer.

### ✅ Day 21-30: Deliver the First Paid Project & Upsell

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Deliver the paid project. **Over-deliver again.** Make the client feel like they got 10x the value they paid for.
- [ ] Upon successful delivery, schedule a follow-up call.
- [ ] On the call, present your **Core Offer** (the $3.5k+ packages) as the logical next step to scale the results you've already achieved for them.
