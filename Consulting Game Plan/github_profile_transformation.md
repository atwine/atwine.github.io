# GitHub Profile Transformation Guide

This guide will transform your GitHub profile from a developer's portfolio into a client-attraction asset. It will align your GitHub presence with the powerful narrative established in your CV and LinkedIn profile.

## 1. Update Your Profile Bio

Your bio is the first thing people see. It should be a concise version of your professional headline.

**Suggested Bio:**
> Healthcare AI Consultant for LMICs | Building production-ready AI solutions that work in the real world | Turning messy data into measurable health outcomes.

---

## 2. Create a Compelling Profile README

Your README is your GitHub homepage. It should tell the same story as your CV's professional summary.

**Instructions:**
Create a `README.md` file in a new public repository named after your GitHub username.

**README Content:**

```markdown
# Healthcare AI Consultant | Turning Data into Decisions Where Resources Are Scarce

I solve complex healthcare data problems in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Having proven my expertise in Uganda's resource-constrained health system, I bring battle-tested approaches ready to scale across Africa. I build AI solutions that work on unreliable power, are understood by overworked healthcare workers, and deliver measurable results.

### How I Deliver Results:
- **I build end-to-end AI/ML solutions** that enable **Faster Outbreak Response**.
- **I create integrated data systems** that optimize **Resource Allocation**.
- **I deliver production-ready solutions** that **Increase Program Effectiveness**.
- **I develop local technical capacity** that **Strengthens Funding Proposals**.

### Trusted by World-Class Funders
My work has been backed by leading global health funders—including the **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, NIH, Lacuna Fund, and Canada's IDRC**—validating my ability to deliver on complex, high-stakes projects.

2.  **HIV Prevention Targeting Model:** (Link to relevant repo) - *Shows direct, quantified health impact.*

## 4. Rewrite Repository Descriptions

For each pinned repository, update its description to be client-focused. Use the "About" section on the repository's main page.

**Template:**
> **Problem:** [Briefly state the client's problem]. **Solution:** [Describe your solution in one line]. **Impact:** [Quantify the result].

**Example (for HIV Prevention Model):**
> Problem: Health orgs struggled to target HIV prevention campaigns effectively. Solution: An ML model to identify at-risk youth from behavioral data. Impact: Enabled 3x more effective campaign targeting.
