## 90-Day Step-by-Step Implementation Guide - ANNOTATED

---

# WEEK 1: FOUNDATION & POSITIONING

## Day 1-2: Brand Positioning & Messaging
### ‚úÖ Task 1: Define Your Unique Value Proposition
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Your UVP needs to solve a specific pain point that generic AI consultants can't address. LMIC organizations are tired of solutions that don't work in their reality.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What specific LMIC challenges have I solved that Western consultants haven't even encountered?
- What's the #1 complaint I hear about previous AI implementations in LMIC settings?
- How can I prove I understand their constraints (power, internet, budget, skills) better than competitors?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Start with problems, not solutions. "I help organizations avoid the $50K AI project failures we see across Africa"
- Use specific examples: "intermittent power," "limited bandwidth," "data in 3 different formats"
- Lead with credibility markers: "Currently deploying systems across Uganda's health network"

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **Write your one-liner (Review Options):**

        - **Option A (Current):** "I help healthcare organizations implement AI that actually works in low-resource settings."

        - **Option B (The Pragmatist):** "I help LMIC health organizations avoid costly AI failures by delivering practical, sustainable solutions that are built for their unique operational realities."

        - **Option C (The Expert Guide):** "I guide international health organizations and NGOs in de-risking their AI investments in Africa, bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and on-the-ground implementation."

        - **Option D (The Impact-Driven):** "I partner with African health institutions to build and deploy AI systems that improve patient outcomes by strengthening local capacity and ensuring long-term technological sovereignty."

        - **Option E (The Specialist):** "I specialize in creating clinically-validated and ethically-sound AI for LMIC health systems, ensuring new technology is trusted and adopted by frontline workers."

        - **Option F (The Direct & Bold):** "I build healthcare AI that works in Africa. No excuses."
- [ ] List 5 specific LMIC challenges you've solved (infrastructure, data scarcity, budget constraints, etc.)

        - [ ] **Infrastructure & Resource Constraints:** Engineered lightweight deployment pipelines using Kubernetes to run modern AI tools (e.g., health chatbots) on low-cost, single-CPU hardware, overcoming typical infrastructure limitations.

        - [ ] **Data Scarcity & Quality:** Addressed chronic data scarcity by designing and implementing FAIR data principles, enabling robust AI modeling from limited and fragmented datasets.

        - [ ] **Budget Constraints & Sustainability:** Designed AI projects focused on long-term sustainability and impact within the tight budgetary realities of donor-funded and public sector initiatives.

        - [ ] **Local Skills Gap & Capacity Building:** Bridged the local AI skills gap by designing and leading training for in-country technical teams, ensuring local ownership and long-term maintainability.

        - [ ] **Integrating with Legacy Systems:** Navigated complex multi-stakeholder environments to integrate modern AI with fragmented legacy health systems, ensuring both technical interoperability and stakeholder buy-in.

        - [ ] **Ensuring Clinical & Scientific Validity:** Ensured the clinical relevance and validity of AI models by co-designing solutions directly with clinicians and researchers, translating complex model outputs into actionable insights for frontline health workers.

        - [ ] **Navigating Ethical & Governance Frameworks:** Successfully navigated the complex ethical and data governance landscapes of LMIC health systems, ensuring all solutions complied with local IRB standards, data sovereignty requirements, and patient privacy regulations.

- [ ] **Document your differentiator: "Real deployments in Uganda, not theoretical consulting"**

        - **Narrative Version:** "Unlike many consultants who offer AI strategies developed in high-resource settings, my expertise is forged from over five years of hands-on deployment within Uganda's public health system. I haven't just designed models; I've navigated the real-world challenges of intermittent power, limited bandwidth, and fragmented data to build solutions that are not only innovative but also sustainable and trusted by local clinical teams. My differentiator is simple: I deliver AI that works in practice, not just on paper."

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Audit Current Materials
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Your current materials probably focus on technical skills rather than LMIC-specific value. Shift from "what you can do" to "what specific problems you solve for organizations like theirs."

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- If an LMIC health director visits my site, do they immediately see their specific challenges addressed?
- Does my content speak to budget constraints, infrastructure limitations, and sustainability concerns?
- Am I accidentally positioning myself as "expensive Western consultant" vs "experienced LMIC practitioner"?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Review each page through the lens of a resource-constrained decision maker
- Look for technical jargon that doesn't connect to business outcomes
- Identify where you're talking about technology instead of talking about their problems

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **CV (`Data Science CV Aug 2024.txt`):**
    - [ ] Add a 2-3 sentence Professional Summary using the "Narrative Version" of your differentiator.
    - [ ] Reframe all experience bullet points to focus on achievements and problems solved, not just responsibilities.
    - [ ] Create a "Key Projects" section to highlight the impact of your major work (e.g., COVID-19 Decision Support System).
- [ ] **LinkedIn Profile:**
    - [ ] Update your headline to a client-facing one-liner (e.g., "Helping LMIC Health Organizations Avoid Costly AI Failures...").
    - [ ] Replace the "About" section with your full differentiator narrative.
    - [ ] Use the "Featured" section to link to key projects and publications.
- [ ] **GitHub Profile:**
    - [ ] Create a profile-level `README.md` that introduces you and highlights key project repositories.
    - [ ] Rewrite the `README.md` for your most important projects to tell a story: Problem, Constraints, Solution, Impact.
- [ ] **Website (In Development):**
    - [ ] Ensure the homepage immediately communicates your unique value proposition to an LMIC health director.
    - [ ] Structure the site around problems you solve, not just a list of technical services.
- [ ] **Facebook Professional Page:**
    - [ ] Create a new, professional Facebook Page separate from your personal profile.
    - [ ] Use it as a distribution channel for blog posts and case studies to a wider audience.
    - [ ] Focus primary professional engagement on LinkedIn, using Facebook more for broad content sharing.
- [ ] **Overall:**
    - [ ] Create a list of content gaps (e.g., missing case studies, testimonials, project impact metrics).

## Day 3-4: Service Package Definition
### ‚úÖ Task 3: Define Your Service Offerings
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** LMIC organizations need different buying options than well-funded Western orgs. They need to see clear ROI, manageable costs, and proof of sustainability before committing to large projects.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What's the smallest engagement that proves value and builds trust?
- How can I structure pricing to work with irregular funding cycles?
- What would make a cautious procurement officer feel confident saying "yes"?
- How do I address the "pilot project graveyard" concern (projects that never scale)?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Create a logical progression: Assessment ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Sustainability
- Price the assessment to be an easy "yes" but substantial enough to demonstrate value
- Include risk mitigation in every package (what happens if funding changes, infrastructure fails, etc.)
- Focus on deliverables they can use even if they don't proceed to next phase

**Create detailed descriptions for:**

**Package 1: Healthcare AI Feasibility Assessment ($3,500)**

- [ ] Deliverable: Long-term maintenance plan
- [ ] Deliverable: Local capacity building program
- [ ] Deliverable: Cost-effective scaling strategy

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Create Service Descriptions
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Lead with the problem they recognize, not the solution you want to sell. LMIC decision-makers are pattern matchers - they've seen AI projects fail and need to understand why yours won't.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What keeps them awake at night regarding AI implementation?
- What specific language do they use when describing their challenges?
- How can I demonstrate understanding of their procurement/approval processes?
- What would make their boss confident in approving this expenditure?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Start each description with a pain point they'll nod their head to
- Use specific examples from your experience, not generic benefits
- Include risk mitigation prominently

- [ ] Why you're uniquely qualified to deliver it

## Day 5-7: Case Study Development
### ‚úÖ Task 5: Document Your Proven Implementations
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Case studies are your strongest sales tool because they prove you've navigated their exact challenges. Focus on the journey and obstacles overcome, not just the technical solution.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What specific constraints did I work within that other consultants wouldn't know how to handle?
- What assumptions did we have to challenge or creative solutions did we develop?
- What would have happened if they'd hired a consultant without LMIC experience?
- How did the solution continue to work after I left?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Structure each case study as a story: Challenge ‚Üí Our Unique Approach ‚Üí Specific Results ‚Üí Ongoing Impact
- Include details about constraints that Western consultants don't face
- Quantify impact where possible, but also include qualitative outcomes

- [ ] Problem: Creating data science platform in resource-constrained environment
- [ ] Solution: FAIR-compliant system designed for local constraints
- [ ] Results: Functional data platform supporting research
- [ ] Lessons: Infrastructure challenges and solutions

### ‚úÖ Task 6: Case Study Format
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Different audiences need different levels of detail. Decision makers want outcomes, technical people want approaches, procurement people want proof of reliability.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- Who will be reading this case study and what do they need to feel confident?
- What specific concerns would this case study address?
- How can I make this feel relevant to their specific situation?
- What proof points do I need to include to build credibility?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Lead with the business outcome, then explain how you achieved it
- Include quotes from clients if possible (even informal feedback)
- Use specific numbers and timelines to build credibility
- Always address the "what happened next" question

**For each case study, create:**
- [ ] 2-page detailed version (for proposals)

**Publish and promote your blog posts:**
- [ ] Post on Medium with relevant tags (AI, Healthcare, Africa, LMIC)
- [ ] Share on LinkedIn with insights commentary
- [ ] Post on Twitter with key takeaways thread
- [ ] Send to email list (if you have one)

### ‚úÖ Task 20.5: Develop Your Lead Magnet
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** A lead magnet is a high-value piece of content you give away for free in exchange for an email address. Its purpose is to move interested readers from "rented land" (social media) to "owned land" (your email list), where you can build trust over time.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What is a common, painful problem my ideal client has that I can help solve in a simple PDF?
- What checklist, template, or resource would save them time or prevent a costly mistake?
- Is this valuable enough that someone would be happy to trade their email for it?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Create a simple, well-designed PDF (e.g., in Canva or Google Docs).
- The lead magnet should be a natural next step from your most popular content.
- Set up a simple landing page (can be done with email marketing tools) to deliver the download.
- Mention your lead magnet at the end of relevant blog posts and LinkedIn articles.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **Brainstorm Lead Magnet Ideas:**
    - [ ] A "AI Project Readiness Checklist for LMIC Health Organizations."
    - [ ] A template for "Calculating the True Cost of an AI Pilot Project."
    - [ ] A curated list of "Top 10 Free AI Tools for Health Data Analysis."
- [ ] **Create the Lead Magnet:** Write the content and design a simple PDF.
- [ ] **Connect to Email System:** Link the lead magnet to your email marketing tool (from Task 23.5) to automatically capture leads.

### ‚úÖ Task 21: Engagement Strategy
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Social media is about building relationships, not broadcasting. Thoughtful engagement with others' content often generates more leads than your own posts.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- Whose content should I be engaging with to get noticed by my ideal clients?
- How can I add value to discussions rather than just promoting myself?
- What conversations am I uniquely qualified to contribute to?
- How do I balance being helpful with being promotional?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Comment with insights that demonstrate your expertise
- Share others' content with your own perspective added
- Start conversations with thoughtful questions
- Be genuinely helpful without always pitching your services

**Daily engagement activities:**
- [ ] Comment thoughtfully on 5 healthcare AI posts
- [ ] Share relevant articles with your insights
- [ ] Engage with your network's content
- [ ] Join 2-3 healthcare AI or LMIC development groups
- [ ] Participate in discussions with valuable insights

# MONTH 2: CLIENT ACQUISITION

## Week 5-6: Proposal Development

### ‚úÖ Task 22: Create Proposal Templates
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Your proposals should feel like a natural extension of your case studies - demonstrating understanding of their challenges and confidence in your approach.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What concerns would prevent them from saying yes to this proposal?
- How can I demonstrate ROI in terms they care about?
- What proof points do I need to include to build confidence?
- How do I address risk without creating new fears?

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Start each proposal by restating their specific challenges
- Use language and examples from your case studies
- Include detailed risk mitigation plans
- Make next steps feel manageable and low-risk

**Develop standardized proposals for each service:**

**Feasibility Assessment Proposal Template:**
*üîç THINKING: This proposal should feel like getting expert advice before making a big decision, not like buying a small project.*
- [ ] Executive summary (problem/solution/outcomes)
- [ ] Your LMIC expertise and relevant experience
- [ ] Detailed methodology and timeline
- [ ] Deliverables and success metrics
- [ ] Investment and payment terms
- [ ] Next steps and timeline

**Implementation Proposal Template:**
*üîç THINKING: Address the "pilot project graveyard" fear by showing clear path to production and sustainability.*
- [ ] Situation analysis (their specific challenges)
- [ ] Proposed solution architecture
- [ ] Implementation phases and milestones
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies (infrastructure, data, etc.)
- [ ] Team structure and roles
- [ ] Budget breakdown and payment schedule

**Sustainability Framework Proposal Template:**
*üîç THINKING: Position this as protecting their investment, not as an additional cost.*
- [ ] Long-term vision and goals
- [ ] Capacity building plan
- [ ] Maintenance and support structure
- [ ] Scaling strategy options
- [ ] ROI projections and success metrics
- [ ] Ongoing partnership opportunities

### ‚úÖ Task 23: Develop Case Study Library
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Case studies are your most powerful client attraction tool. They aren't just project summaries; they are compelling stories that prove you can solve your client's exact problems. The goal is for a prospect to read a case study and think, "This person understands my world. I need to talk to them."

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What was the core **Problem** the client was facing before I arrived?
- What were the specific **Constraints** of the LMIC environment (data, power, skills)?
- What was the elegant **Solution** I designed and deployed?
- What was the measurable **Impact** or outcome for the client? (e.g., "reduced diagnostic time by 40%")

**üéØ Implementation Approach:**
- Structure each case study like a story: Problem, Constraints, Solution, Impact.
- "Give away the secrets" by explaining *how* you solved the problem. This builds trust and authority.
- Tailor the "Impact" section for different audiences (e.g., ROI for private sector, sustainability for government).

**Create industry-specific case study versions:**
- [ ] **Core Story:** Write the full story for each major project (e.g., COVID Decision Support).
- [ ] **NGO Version:** Emphasize budget efficiency and grant compliance.
- [ ] **Government Version:** Emphasize scalability, security, and sustainability.
- [ ] **Research Institution Version:** Emphasize methodological rigor and innovation.
- [ ] **Private Healthcare Version:** Emphasize ROI and competitive advantage.

### ‚úÖ Task 23.5: Set Up Foundational Automation Systems
**üß† STRATEGIC THINKING:** Automation saves time and ensures no lead falls through the cracks. The goal is to systematize repetitive tasks (scheduling, follow-ups) so you can focus on high-value conversations. Start with simple, effective tools.

**üí≠ Key Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What is the most time-consuming, repetitive part of my outreach and follow-up process?
- How can I make it effortless for a potential client to book a meeting with me?
- What would make someone bookmark this and share it with colleagues?

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **Explore & Select Tools:** Research and choose providers for the following. Prioritize tools with good free tiers to start.
    - [ ] **Professional Email (Critical Decision):** Review the two main options.
        - [ ] **Option A (Basic):** Standard email from your domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap's Business Email). Pro: Very low cost. Con: Basic interface, limited storage, and lacks integration with other tools.
        - [ ] **Option B (Recommended for Consultants):** Google Workspace. Pro: Professional email (`you@yourdomain.com`) inside the powerful Gmail interface, plus the entire Google suite (Drive, Docs, Calendar, Meet). It's the industry standard for efficiency and professionalism. Con: Higher cost (approx. $6/month).
        - [ ] **Decision Point:** For seamless workflow and client trust, Google Workspace is the recommended path.
    - [ ] **Scheduling:** Calendly, SavvyCal, or similar.
    - [ ] **Email Marketing:** Mailchimp, Substack, ConvertKit, or similar.
    - [ ] **Proposal Management (Optional):** PandaDoc, Better Proposals.
- [ ] **Implement Scheduling Automation:**
    - [ ] Set up your chosen scheduling tool.
    - [ ] Create different event types (e.g., "30-Min Discovery Call", "15-Min Intro Chat").
    - [ ] Add the scheduling link to your email signature and LinkedIn profile.
- [ ] **Implement Email Nurturing:**
    - [ ] Set up your chosen email marketing tool.
    - [ ] Create a simple sign-up form to embed on your future website/blog.
    - [ ] Draft a 3-part automated "welcome" email sequence for new subscribers (e.g., deliver content, share a case study, offer a call).

## Week 7-8: Direct Sales Activities

### ‚úÖ Task 24: Qualify and Approach Prospects
