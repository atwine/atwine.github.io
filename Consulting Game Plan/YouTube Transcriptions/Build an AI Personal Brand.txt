hey guys in today's video we're going to focus on the number one problem that's holding back 99% of AI developers and creators and the problem is that your skills are not getting the attention that they deserve and the reason that this is a problem is if your skills aren't getting noticed by the right people they can't hire you they can't pay you and they can't send opportunities your way and I know that this is a real problem cuz I had faced it myself I was putting in the work I was becoming a better developer and I

was building real world projects but no matter what it felt like I was doing it felt like I wasn't getting the attention I deserve and I was just going unnoticed and this was super frustrating cuz I couldn't land new jobs or new opportunities to get paid more but then I made one single change that completely flipped the script and changed everything for me I started to build an AI personal brand and the rest has just been crazy s this single change took me from being unknown to tripling my total

income through new jobs freelancing opportunities digital products coaching and more opportunities than I can honestly keep up with and in today's video I'm going to share my entire play and give it all away completely for free so that you can start building your own AI personal brand that attracts clients job opportunities and ultimately unlocks new income streams for you and the part you'll love the most is that any AI developer or Creator can follow this exact Playbook and go off in Crush in

fact I've seen it in my own eyes as I've worked with multiple students for example I've worked with Tim who is focused on building a YouTube channel around helping developers Implement AI into their workflows before working with me Tim was was able to create three videos get a few hundred views and around 9 subscribers after working with me and understanding how to properly position himself and create viral YouTube content his next three videos ended up generating over 15,000 views and hundreds of subscribers he was able

to get months of progress in three videos which is insane and this ultimately unlocked the ability for him to Rack in new freelance work and ultimately create his own School community and he's just been crushing it ever since additionally I've worked with Alexandra who was already figuring out the content game but struggling to figure out how to properly monetize it after working through strategy she's now on her way to get over $10,000 a month through different freelance opportunities and business opportunities

and she's been crushing it but that's not where the story ends because we've also helped her unlock the potential of LinkedIn to where now she's able to go off and generate posts that get over 100,000 views and are just raking in even more paid opportunities for her so she's just absolutely crushing it as well and in the rest of this video we're going to be focusing on exactly what steps you need to take as well so that you can copy their success and go off and build your own AI personal brand and

absolutely crush it and because you guys are awesome and I really want you to go off and crush it I went ahead and put together a 5-day email master class on building an AI personal brand that goes in much more detail that I'm able to in today's video and I've already went ahead and sent it to a few people and they've absolutely loved it so far so I'm sure you as well I'll have a link to it down the description below if you want to check it out and get even more support on creating your own AI personal

brand but enough of that let's go ahead and actually quickly cover what we're going to be doing in the rest of the video first off we're going to talk about what is an AI personal brand and why you should care about it then what we're going to dive into next is the five core pillars of creating your own AI personal brand so you can understand how they all work together to ultimately just you know work to make you a lot of money and I think you'll definitely want to stay around to the end because pillar

four and five are my absolute favorite and I'm sure you guys are going to love them too and by the end of this video you're going to have a clear picture and acual steps on what you need to do next to go off and create your own AI personal brand and start raking in the money so I hope you guys are super excited like I am and let's go ahead and dive into the first part and cover what the heck is an AI personal brand all right so now it's time to go ahead and dive into the fun stuff so what the heck

is an AI personal brand well an AI personal brand is just like a regular personal brand but it's on steroids it's all about showcasing your skills expertise in your projects online without an AI personal brand no one's going to know who you are and how you can help them but with an AI personal brand everyone's going to know exactly what you do and how you can help them and instead of just being another developer or Creator you're going to be tying your name to AI which is the biggest and most in demand skill in the

world right now and we're not just going to be talking about AI on your personal brand we're going to be using it because right now inside of an AI personal brand we're going to be using AI to streamline your content automate your workflows and maximize your output to help you stand out even more and it turns your work into a magnet for New Opportunities and with an AI personal brand it's going to bring the right opportunities to you and let me tell you why this matters because if you don't build an AI personal brand

you're going to be forever stuck going off and chasing opportunities so if you're trying to get a new job it's going to be you sending applications if you're trying to get new freelance opportunities it's going to be you pitching clients and you're just hoping that someone stumbles upon you and just magically notices who you are and what you can do but with an AI personal brand it flips the script and opportunities chase you I've seen this with my own and it's the craziest thing you'll ever see

because once you have an AI personal brand clients are going to reach out to you cuz they already know what you can do and how you can help them employers are going to go off and see your work and invite you to go ahead and get a job you'll just wake up with DMS in your LinkedIn inbox of hey please come work from us which is a drastic change without having an ad personal brand because you're just hoping to God that someone magically responds to one of the hundreds of applications that you send out and instead of proving yourself in

an interview you're content that you've already generated has proven what you're capable of doing so it eliminates all the friction so all the opportunities just flood to your inbox and this is exactly like I've said what's happened to me and other AI developers that I've worked with and I will go ahead and say that building an AI personal brand isn't for everyone let me explain here's who an AI personal brand is for if you're an AI developer or Creator who's already building real world Solutions this is

for you if you're someone who loves experimenting with AI creating projects and like pushing the boundaries of what's possible you're in the right place and if you're tired of being overlooked and want to start attracting inbound opportunities this is going to change everything for you now I will say if you've never built an AI project or anything before this is not for you and the first step for you is to actually go off pause and go ahead and start focusing on becoming a builder first and luckily for you I've dedicated my entire

channel to helping you do just that definitely recommend checking out my cayi videos L chain videos and my AI would make videos to go ahead and get started building real world AI solutions that enable you to provide value to the world now now that we've kind of clarified you know what an AI personal brand is why it matters and also who it's for let's go ahead and start focusing on the next step was making sure that you stand out and the reason this is so important is because if you don't position yourself in the right way

you'll blend in with everyone else and won't stand out which means it's harder for opportunities to come find you and that's where our first pillar comes in which is all about defining your brand positioning so let's go ahead and hop into pillar number one so we can start going ahead and setting you up for Success on building your own AI personal brand oh and real quick before we dive into covering the five pillars of building your AI personal brand I just want you to know if you are looking for

it's time for us to start diving into pillar number one and talk about your brand positioning with inside of your AI personal brand so what is this well your brand position is how people online instantly recognize you it's what you do it's who you help and it's why these viewers should follow you and if you get this part right picking your Niche it's going to make everything else 10 times easier and if you get it wrong like I did when I first started out you're going to waste months creating content

that no one cares about and it's ultimately just going to confuse your viewers if you don't pick a proper brand position so it's super important to note that if you're clear about about your brand positioning the Right audience will eventually find you and once they find you they stick around because they know what you stand for and what value you provide so let me quickly cover my mistakes when starting out and how I fixed them so that you don't run into the same mistakes that I did so when I first started out I had zero positioning

I was everywhere at first I was like I'm just going to make content about AI so I was like well I'm going to show people how to make a children's book using Ai and then I was like o wait I can now use Twitter and I'm going to make an automation bot bot using AWS and then I was like well now back to Ai and going to do a landing page so all around I was all over the place and as a result I started to gain some small amount of traction but then it was ultimately just confusing my audience cuz they're like

wait are you about Twitter are you about the cloud are you about AI what are you here to help me for and ultimately I was just confusing my entire audience and I really wasn't even building an audience I was just confusing people cuz I was hopping around left and right so here's the fix you have to focus and pick a niche now let me tell you how so when you're creating your channel you need to dominate a small slice of YouTube you can't be everywhere and the goal is to position yourself as the goto Authority

on a very specific topic and not just be another Creator creating content all over the place and the more focused you are with your Niche the easier it is for you to attract the audience and also more importantly avoid competition so something that's super important to know before you dive in to start building your AI personal brand on all these different social media platforms is that YouTube in specific is hyperco competitive you have some of the greatest and smart people out there making content and it's really a winner

take all platform so think of it whoever is the best in a specific topic they're usually the go-to source and it's really hard to compete to get views in that same area which is why we want to focus on standing out and not fight for attention and here's how we can start doing it and also I do want to mention we just want to make winning easy as we go off and build our AI personal brand so here's how we can do it you're going to follow the AI plus two topic Frameworks and let me quickly explain what this is so the AI Plus two topic

framework is when you combine AI with two other topics what this allows you to do is position yourself as the expert but in a specific Niche rather than competing with every creator online who's talking about AI so for example let's just imagine that if you wanted to say I'm going to be the AI guy well are you going to create content about the newest models that are coming out are you going to create content about how AI can be used inside of sales teams are you going to talk about how AI can be

used for Developers as you can see it's too big and too broad and as a result no one's going to know why they should follow you because you're talking about everything all over the place so with our AI plus two topic Frameworks here's exactly what you should be doing instead you should pick Ai and then two other topics so in my case I like to talk about AI fullstack development and business ultimately I mix all three of these and that little area in the middle is how I come up with my Niche so I get

to talk a little bit about AI models but how it relates to full stack devel velopment and real world use cases for business so that's how I've gone about picking out my specific Niche and I recommend you doing the same and let me show you and tell you why this works it's hard to be a top 1% Creator in a broad Niche just like I talked about AI as a whole but when you combine all three of those different topics together that overlap right in the middle helps you specialize in a specific Niche and

just establish your Authority so that you become the go-to person and one of the other reasons why this is so easy and so important for beginners starting out the journey is it makes content creation easier because you have a clear focus on what you need to be talking about and it prevents you from you know chasing the shiny object of like oh that's cool that's cool it really put some blinders on you and help you focus on what you need to be creating also it's going to help you attract the right audience it's

the people who really care about what you have expertise on and they will just as time goes on be you know attracted magnetically over to you because you have all the right problems you've already solved them on your channel and they're just going to keep coming back for more and more which is just going to attract even more more similar people in the same audience and the other part that makes this so awesome is your audience instantly knows why they should follow you because as your topic is really focused on providing you know as

your sorry as your content is focused strictly on those three different topics and you're showcasing how you can build things solve problems the audience knows oh I need to follow him because he's going to help me solve those same problems so that's why people are going to follow you so let me go ahead and actually just get really concrete with this and show you a few other examples of this in action so let's go ahead and look at a few different channels that are super you know popular on YouTube so

Matthew Burman who is he and what is his Niche well as you can see over here on the left his channel is mostly focused on you know the trendy new thing that's happening so what he's focused on is AI plus news and then use cases of how these different AI are showing up so if you're in his world every time a new something with AI pops up you're going to want to go to his channel to watch to see what's going on so this is exactly how he has picked it in this way he doesn't have to go too deep into coding

he doesn't have to go too deep into anything else he is strictly AI news and sharing use cases to inspire other developers and creators in the space another one Jack Roberts awesome Creator his Focus as you can see in his channel is focused on Ai No code and automations he has an entire School community and YouTube channel dedicated to doing exactly these three things and he has become the go-to guy for these different topics additionally another example mvin phenomenal developer HS focus is on AI

developers and use cases so if you want quick mini tutorials on how to use a new framework for developers that relates to AI he always has a video on it and he's very timely so as soon as it come out boom he has a quick tutorial that you can see like 5 minutes or less of showing you how to use this new technology and how it can be used so all around as you can see just by mixing up these three different variables you can produce wildly different content and completely different channels so I'm hoping you're starting to see the power

of this framework so here action steps for you when it comes to setting up your brand positioning for your new AI personal brand first we want you to ultimately pick your Niche and here's how you're going to do it first I recommend going off and researching other YouTube channels in on YouTube that you find interesting to see what's working what's not working then I'd like you to reflect on what do you like to make and talk about so for example I read business books I in my free time I just watch you know all sorts of

business podcast so I love business also if you were just to like give me unlimited free time I would just code and build all sorts of cool real world projects and I love AI so that's how I picked mine I just like to focus on what do I enjoy doing and now I'm going to go off and create content in the real world about that and ultimately attract an audience that likes and has the same interest as me so you have to do some inward reflection to figure out what you like next I'm a huge fan of putting out

a road map of just guessing like okay if I do pick this Niche and I want to focus on these three topics what kind of cont content would I create and do I like it if you do like the type of content you would go off and create success you now have a great topic that you can focus on if after doing your road map and trying to figure out like well you know I could only really create one video in this area if I pick these three topics we might need to take a step back and do and rearrange the different topics we

pick so you'll hop back to the the reflect stage so you're going to use these three steps together to go off and start creating your own AI Niche that you should focus on now now that we've already talked about you know picking your personal brand brand we now need to start focusing on the next step which is creating a Content engine where you're actually going to produce videos and valuable content that's going to help grow your audience on autopilot and this is actually where most people get stuck

they have a great idea they're going to do a specific you know Niche on YouTube and Linkedin but then they never get started so they either just never make a post because they're afraid or they're not sure if it's actually going to provide value or they do one or two posts and then give up because they instantly don't go viral and they never get any interraction and that's what we're going to talk about the next section we're going to specifically dive into actually how you can build your content engine properly so that it feels

much easier and you don't give up and it the whole point of this content engine is to actually attract the ride audience go ahead and grow your Authority so deals start coming in and ultimately create new opportunities for you to start making money that's what we're here about so let's go ahead and hop over to pillar number two where we're going to start diving into creating your own content engine so let's go ahead and hop over so now that we've picked a topic that we want to talk about it's time for us to dive into pillar number

two where we're going to start talking about how we're going to create our content engine that's going to grow our audience on autopilot so before we dive into talking about what is the content engine and how it's going to work let's clearly Define what are the goals that we want our content engine to do for us and our AI personal brand so first off we want to make sure that our content engine is just more it's more than posting videos it really comes down to a system designed to help us with three

core goals first we want to make sure that our content engine and every piece of content that we produce attracts leads and new opportunities to us 24/7 around the clock so that we get new deals while we're sleeping that's our goal we also want to make sure that each piece of content we're posting helps build Authority so that people trust us as the experts that we are we're smart we're competent we know what we're doing we just want the world to know it as well next we want to make sure that each

piece of content we create is highly leveraged so that each piece of content works for you long after you post it so we want today's work to pay dividends for weeks months and years going forward so if you get your content engine strategy right it's going to work for you around the clock and each piece of content you produce is going to help it bring in new job offers new clients freelancing work coaching clients and honestly more opportunities than you can even keep up with it's once it works it's insane how well it pays off but if

you get this wrong you're going to waste so much time creating content that no one really cares about and it's not going to lead to real world opportunities in the ultimate outcome that you're shooting for so we need to get this right now before we dive into like all the exact strategies I just want you to know I have failed on this hard in the past in fact before I launched the YouTube channel that you're watching right now I actually launched a previous one and it bombed it tanked my big idea was I was going to create a

vlog startup that was focused on my journey of building an AI startup and as you can see I posted three videos I maxed out at like 100 views the content was completely wrong it was all me focused it wasn't focused on providing value to the viewers and it just it absolutely crashed in fact on the last video I got two comments one comment was like Hey Watch no one care about what you're building and the other one was I hope you fail and I was like this YouTube thing is awful I hate it and I actually gave up I quit right then and

there and it took a full year before I thought about doing it again but I did not give up that was the important part a full year later I came back and this time I was focused on building a real content engine that was going to work for me and I completely changed everything about my strategy and once I made this big change everything changed for me and way worked out way better and as you can see on this channel it's exploding ever since so here's exactly what you need to do when it comes to building your content engine first every

time we're creating a new piece of content we want to make sure that it's high value and leverageable content and we'll dive deeper into this in just a second next every time we are you know making sure that we're producing content we want to make sure that we're going to put it on platforms that have high organic reach and Longevity so think YouTube where you post a video today and people will watch it for years to come and we also want to post content on LinkedIn because it works for months out

into the future and this is super important because I know a lot of us have full-time jobs and we really need to crank on that leverage knob so that we can do work once and then the content will work for us as a digital asset and we're not going to be posting on content on platforms like X because it's a constant Rat Race and you're running on a hamster wheel cuz every 24 hours the clock starts over and we don't have time for that and next in every piece of content that we produce we're going to

give away everything we're not going to hold back anything and here's why people pay for two things they pay for implementation and acceleration and that's what we're here for we're here to start a business we're not here just to get popular we are starting a business so let me explain people pay for implementation and specifically taking a step back when we create high value content that gives away all our secrets and shares everything people are going to two types of people are going to pay for it one future employers and clients

are going to pay for implementation because they see that oh my gosh this guy can do exact what I want he's crushing it I need him to do that for me so they're going to pay for implementation also there are beginner developers and creators that are a few steps behind you that want to accelerate their journey to get where you're at so they're going to pay for coaching digital products and more opportunities to get where you're at so that's why we're going to give it all away for free not hold anything back cuz knowledge is

not the limiting factor it's it's actually implementation is a limiting factor and direct coaching and helping people where they're at to get from where they're at to where they're going so paying for acceleration so next what we want to do inside of our content engine is we want to focus on building out an email list we are on rented land when we're on YouTube and Linkedin and we want to bring them into our ecosystem and we're going to do that through irresistible lead magnets and the reason why is not everyone's ready to hire or

buy from you today but if they join your email list and you continually provide value over time they might be at a later date and that way we can start to collaborate and provide value to one another and the way we're going to do this is like I said do an irresistible lead magnet so think for example a free source code a cheat sheet or a mini course all of these are great examples of lead magnets so for example in this video I've talked about I've actually created a much deeper dive of the five

pillars of creating an AI personal brand I go way deeper than I can in this YouTube video and I definitely recommend you checking that down the description below see exactly what we're doing here as well next what we're going to do is in the third step of our content engine is we are going to repurpose and multiply your efforts so what I mean by that is every time you generate a lead magnet for your YouTube video we're going to work to repurpose it to go over to LinkedIn why is because we as developers and creators have very

limited time so we need to structure our setup in a way to where we get to maximize all the juice and all the value from everything that we do because we only have so many hours in the day and we want to post on these platforms that going to give us exponential results so let me give you an example why we want to actually go ahead and put our lead magnet on multiple platforms is because the more people can see our name the faster your Authority grows and the more opportunities are going to come your way

and ultimately the more value that you put out into the world the more opportunities are going to come your way so it's a win-win and that's why we're going to repurpose all lead magnets over from YouTube to LinkedIn as well and let me just give you a quick a concrete example of this Alexandra one of the students I've worked with she worked on creating an awesome video on mixtures of Agents created a great lead magnet of oh by the way you can download this template and then repurposed it over to

LinkedIn the same one like I said were squeezing all the juice out of everything we create and this lead magnet exploded so as you can see on YouTube it got 3,000 views great but she repurposed the same league magnet but just packaged it differently in a LinkedIn post and it exploded this one post got over 100,000 Impressions over on LinkedIn that's led to five paid opportunities and it's just exploded so hopefully the dots are connecting on like oh wow the power of repurposing content in your content engine is insane

so now we've kind of talked high level what we need to be doing in our content let's actually dive into some more actionable steps on what you need to be doing in creating you know proven content formats that you can copy and start creating videos on today so what are we going to do first well the easiest way to create content for our Niche is to actually do a curated list now this type of video format or LinkedIn post format is great for a few reasons you are going to say hey I've done a lot of research and a lot of work

and I put together the most high value actionable items that I think are going to blow your mind and I'm just going to give it to you in a simple list people love list that's the other reason why this format works so well is because it clearly explain to the viewer or the reader what they're going to get out of this video and how you're going to take them from their current state which is interested to the final state which is like oh wow that was awesome you gave me a ton of value and we're going to do

that in a format of a list cuz the user will know and the viewer will know okay he's going to show me three items so I can expect in the rest of this video or post to see three items that are going to be awesome so that's why this really works so well and just to give you a concrete example of this we could do some sort of video saying like hey here are three mind-blowing examples of open AI 03 Mini model that you should steal so this is a really good example of like hey I've found all these things let's go

ahead and let me show them to you so you can see we're going to do you know item one example one example two example three and at the Final End we're going to say oh by the way I've made an awesome lead magnet for you guys as well where I've actually went off and found an additional five examples that will love click the link down description below and I'll shoot them over to you as well so it's always give value and then with our lead magnet we're going to give even more value next another format that

is proven that you guys should definitely copy and steal as you're going off to create your first rounds of content is a simple how-to guide strictly a step-by-step guide so the reason why this format works is because it provides immediate value to the reader or viewer and there's a clear actionable outcome so by following this how-to guide by the end of it I know the goal is I should be able to do the thing and and it really showcases how technical we are what we're able to do and our problem solving skills so once

again we're building up our Authority at the same time let me give you a concrete example of this and why it's such a good one so we could say hey uh in this video I'm going to show you how to build an AI agent that scrapes competitor prices in five steps that is a very clear outcome I instantly know what the entire video is about I know the entire format I know if I was to click on this video right now that there would probably be some sort of intro and then there'd be step 1 2 3 4 5 and by the end of five I would

have a bot or agent that could go off and let me see all my competitor's prices very clear I know what I'm going to get out of this video before even clicking on it and then the video format uh once again show the five steps and at the end we'll say oh by the way here's the lead magnet here is all the code that you saw inside the AI agent just go ahead and download it completely for free Link in the description below so hopefully you're starting to get the format and feel for this and the the way

we should go about creating content in our content engine and then finally the third format that you should steal is the tip Insight list so with this one what we're doing is actually just aggregating a bunch of high impact lessons to our audience because you know we as the expert have a ton of expertise in a certain domain and we're just going to say hey I've spent hundreds of hours you know thousands of dollars working in this field and here are a few tips and insights on how you should go about

doing X and the reason why this works so well once again it paints a clear Journey For What the viewer should do like here's five tips on how to do X paints a clear Journey For What the user is going to experience as they're going watching the video or reading the book and they're also going to you know once again you know have a clear understanding of what they're going to get out of it so another example for this one would be hey in today's video I'm going to give you seven tips for AI developers to use cursor like a pro so

this video very clear outcome I I'm curious in cursor and I do want to know how to actually use it better so I'm actually going to go off and create a video on this exact subject later on because I think this is a between Claude and cursor there's a lot of interesting things you can do in this field so same format I'm going to show seven tips and at the very end I'm going to say oh by the way if you would like to see even more tips check the league magnet down below get it completely for free and

you'll see another eight tips that I've added for you guys completely for free so hopefully it's starting to all make sense of how it all connects together now we know what type of content we need to be making where we need to post it we even know the format of what type of content to create but now we need to focus on avoiding the most common mistakes IC beginners do as are going off and starting to crank up and build their content engine so let's go ahead and dive in so the first thing is as beginners go off and start creating

YouTube videos and Linkedin post they don't hook the viewer and if you don't hook the viewer between your title thumbnail and your intro basically the rest of the work is wasted because if someone doesn't click it doesn't matter how awesome the video is on the inside if they don't click they don't watch and if they don't watch they don't get value which means you're not going to get opportunities and leads so you have to hook the viewer you should spend the majority of your time in the beginning

thinking about clearly how to create a title and thumbnail that brings in people to clearly watch your video and gets them excited to watch all right another major mistake that I've seen beginners make time and time again is they start filming without a clear three line so they're going to go they get inspired by something they see and they just start recording and then they're kind of starting off talking about Ai and then they hop over to oh I learned some lessons back from when I started my first job that you're going to find

helpful too cuz it's helped me and then oh yeah and then here by the way here's that quick how to guide on as we're you know talking about this oh and here's a deep dive on this random subject and like they kind of hop around and what ends up happening is they get done with the video and then they go shoot what should the title for this be and because they've scattered everything all over the place the title will never match the viewers expectations of what they're going to watch each video should have a

clear single purpose and a clear single title that work together and just make it very easy for the viewer we want to keep things clear because a confused viewer leaves so the actual tip out of this is focus on a clear title first that you would want to click yourself and then focus on creating the video second then the third major mistake that I see most developers make and sorry creators make on you know LinkedIn YouTube is they stop way too soon they quit they make a few videos they don't get the millions of views that they

expected they were going to get and they just give up and I know I've seen this myself heck I did it myself the first time I created YouTube CU I just did not know what I was doing until I invested in coaching courses and everything to figure out how the heck this game works and the biggest mistake that people do is the comparison game they see you know the Mr Beast the huge YouTube channel that gets hundreds of thousands of views and they say dang my video only got like 500 views this is not what I thought it

was going to be it's much harder I'm not getting job offers I'm going to give up and the trick is do not play the comparison game to other people play the comparison game against your future self so you know is your second video better than your first great just keep doing that and don't give up the only way you lose this game is by not quitting or sorry the only way you lose this game is by quitting so if you don't quit you're eventually just ultimately going to win so hopefully that makes sense as well

now the solution to these major problems and the way I like to think about it to like really help you know stay in it for the long game and this is an infinite game you can keep playing it forever is to treat every piece of content that you create is an asset that's going to compound over time and work for you 24/7 around the clock so every time you make a video it's another shot at getting your Authority out there and to go off and work as a digital asset 24/7 to bring in people into your sphere so that

you get more opportunities and just the rest it just works so don't give up and just think everything that you're doing it's a little soldier fighting for you 24/7 around the clock and we just have to you know slowly build up our army all right so we've gone through everything that you need to know about creating your content engine and I want to go ahead and give you immediate steps that you should take heck right now pause the video and start working on these or immediately after watching this so

here's what you need to do next when it comes to creating your first pieces of content first pick a proven content format so like I said earlier let's get that curated list a how-to guide or a simple list of insights next we're going to write a strong clickable title before doing anything else so the best thing I like to do is think of what's a good video title that I would want to watch myself so in my head I would love to watch a quick how-to guide or quick seven tips on how to best use Claude 3.7

with cursor I would want to watch that video right now so I'm going to go off research do all the finding around and experimenting and create that video cuz I'm if I have that video that I want to watch I know there's probably thousands of other people that also want to watch the same thing and we want to be very clear in the title seven tips for how to best use clawed with a cursor boom very very simple next after we have clearly defined our title we want to work on making our engaging hook so the first 30

seconds are the most important of the whole YouTube video I have more information on this in the 5-day master class in the email below but basically the first 30 seconds are the most important part of the whole video Once someone clicks and if you confuse them they're going to just dip and your views won't explode on the video finally we need to focus on making that irresistible lead magnet for your video that you pick so think cheat seets source code resource guides or just more of what you did in the video that always

works and our ultimate goal is to get people off YouTube and Linkedin and in our email list so hopefully that all makes sense and now that you understand like how to go off and create content that attracts attention it's not enough the next step is actually to start turning that attention into real world opportunities and like I said content is not enough on its own and if you're not actively connecting and engaging with people that message you on your videos and post you're just leaving an insane

amount of money on the table and that's what in pillar three it's all about it's all about transforming your audience that's engaged into valuable relationships some collaborations and paid opportunities so that everybody can win so let's go ahead and hop over to pillar number three so you can see this all in action all right guys so welcome to pillar number three strategic networking where we're going to focus on turning in all those content that we're generating into actual conversations so those conversations can turn into high

paying opportunities so let's go ahead and dive in so one of the things that's super important to note is posting content is just the start of building your AI personal brand because if you're not actively engaging with the people that are commenting dimming or reaching out to you as you post content you're leaving massive amount of opportunities on the table that could turn into really highp paying deals so here's the problem content alone is not enough views and likes don't pay the bills but conversation with real people who have

problems that we can solve they do that is what pays the bills so if you're just posting and waiting for opportunities coming to you you're missing the point here if someone watches your video they find it valuable and they drop a comment like hey this is super helpful well if you don't go off and start a conversation with them how can they ever hire you refer you or know you even offer help so that's exactly what we're focusing on in this strategic networking pillar and this is where most creators

fail they just don't fully complete the loop they get it started but they just don't go 100% so they create the content that brings in the views which brings people directly to them but they never engage which never allows the cycle to complete and get them paid so here's exactly how we're going to fix it with the Strategic networking so instead of waiting for opportunities to start the conversations here's exactly what we're going to do first we're going to engage so every time someone reaches out with a

comment a DM or interacts with us in any way possible we're going to engage and once we engage we're most our whole goal is to help we're try we're here to provide help and provide value to the world to show showcase our expertise and that we're an authority in the space so if they mention that they're having a problem we're going to offer free value that's all we're trying to do here free value because as long as we put enough Goodwill into the Universe I promise you it's going to come back tenfold we'll

talk more about that later on but if someone does reach out with a prom we're going to say hey I actually helped a lot of developers in this space with that exact same issue can we hop on a quick call for an hour 30 minutes so I can help you out and that opportunity and that conversation can lead to a real opportunity for you we'll talk way more about how to monetize and pillar number four but for right now just know this could be a really great opportunity for us and then finally what we're going to

do after that quick conversation the whole goal is to go hey I've had a great talk with you for the past 45 minutes I've given you everything that I know about solving this problem and then we're going to go with the O by the way method where we're going to say oh by the way I've actually helped coach a lot of developers who want to do exactly what you're trying to do in the past and I'd be happy to help then we can drop an hourly rate we can drop a bundle of like hey I think it'll take four coaching

calls to get you where you want to go is that something you'd be interested in and the reason why this works so well is because over the past 45 minutes of the conversation we've just dropped knowledge bomb knowledge bomb knowledge bomb so we've eliminated all friction because they see we clearly understand the problem we've already told them how to do it like the how is not the magic sauce if you remember back from earlier people pay for implementation and speed and we can offer help on either cuz we

could build it if they want us to or we could coach them along along the way so that's our whole goal value value value and at the end hey I can help help and it's also important to mention if we can't help totally fine that happens all the time but what we're trying to do here is basically play out the role of just provide massive value to everyone that interacts with us and put as much Goodwill and Karma into the universe cuz like I said it will come back tfold and just to give you a quick caveat if you

can't help totally fine because you could always play matchmaker where you say hey I personally cannot help solve this issue I obviously told you everything that I think you should be doing but I also know this guy who you would really like to connect with so you can always play matchmaker as well and that's something else that I think you would find interesting it's crazy how many cool people you're going to meet as you go off and engage in this strategic networking now let me explain why this

matters first off it builds trust and people buy from people they trust and that's clearly at the beginning of the whole call when we're doing a strategic call with someone we're just offering value and clearly establishing we know what we're doing and building trust it also helps create opportunities so what I mean by that is even if the person we help doesn't need you know want more help right now they might later and that's so important because we're just trying to we're playing the long game

here and and we just know deals might not always come in but we just want to know be known as the person who can solve problem so whenever someone does need help they reach out to us or they tell their friend who's probably in the same space of like hey I know a guy that could help you with the exact problem they're doing so we're just trying to create a network of people that know exactly what we do and how we can help people so anytime on that person's radar an opportunity or issue comes up they're

going to be directing them to us so this is a really cool way of how we can exponentially grow our Network to just attract opportunities left it's wild h how many things are going to come your way and then finally I do want to go ahead and say if you ignore this it's going to feel like YouTube and this whole AI personal brand isn't working and the reason why is cuz you're going to start getting the views you're going to get the thousands of views maybe even tens of thousands of views but then you're not going to get any results

meaning you're not going to get any paid clients and it's because of that Gap right in the middle where we're not having conversations so the second you start having conversations with real people the pipeline is complete and you're going to start getting real opportunities just fall in your lap and if you don't do these conversations it's going to feel like you're just posting in the void and you're getting views but nothing's happening so do not ignore this advice about doing strategic networking so let me go ahead and share

you some my personal stories that I had as I've gone off and started to actually engage in this exact strategy that I've been sharing with you guys so I do just quick bit of background is when I started I was so hesitant about you know going on these strategy calls helping people out what if I don't know what they need help with what if what if what if they think I'm dumb you know I had so many like faulty beliefs of you know instead of just going out providing value to the world I was just kind of

like I'm just going to hold it all in because you know that's how people are going to come and find me cuz I'm an expert I know what I'm talking about and it's just up to them to understand it and that's not the case what you have to do is you have to provide all the value on the call because we are the expert and we're confident in our abilities so what I did to start is cu I was unsure what to do is I started offering free strategy calls on all of my YouTube videos hey you want help I have a account the link in the description

below let's hop on a call I will help you with whatever issue you're running into cuz I just want to start bringing people into my ecosystem so I can start helping out and the part that is very interesting about doing it is everything started to change after I was doing this strategic networking so let me show you the second I started opening up my doors for people to come in and start engaging with me my calendar instantly became booked it was wild overnight I was like well I have no more free time at nights

CU I'm just going to be on calls with people left and right offering value and here's all the awesome things that came from it first off I would get on a call with someone who was thinking about building some sort of AI tool course of an hour I would spend the majority of it saying here's exactly how I would go about building and solving the problem that you're having and then at the end of the call you know the guy would just look at me and go can I hire you like right now are you looking for a new job

so that just blew my mind of just like by helping someone out for 45 minutes an instant job offer would just fall on your lap also Consulting gigs will pop up all the time of like hey we clearly see what you're doing you now understand where our problems are would you be interested in like you know teaching our CEO or teaching our team about how to use AI for our speciic specific Niche so those come into your lap as well and those pay very well and then finally you also get to meet a lot of awesome

developers who you know a few steps behind you but want to get where you're at so for example you might get a developer to say like hey I watched your latest video it was awesome here's what I'm trying to build over the course of the 4 five minutes we break down hey man here's the three steps you need to do to build the project if I was in your shoes and at the very end of it you always get one of two options hey would you actually be interested in building this for me I can pay you or or the developer

would go oh I really want to understand how to do this myself do you offer coaching so either way you can always help in any of these situations and it just completely blew my mind that I would just you know I wasn't seeing results until I started doing this and the second I started doing this I was it's a game changer and I never want to stop having conversations with real world people cuz it closed the loop and all the opportunities started to flood in and then the best part about this is I had a lot of faulty beliefs of like

man I have to have 30,000 50,000 100,000 subscribers for this to actually start working and that's not true I was probably in the low thousands of subscribers when I started doing this and as I've worked with like Alexander Tim and others people are starting to get conversations like when they have hundreds of subscribers it's wild and the reason why it worked is because we're planting our flag on a specific Niche and we are showing that we are the best at what we do so you don't have to have thousand subscribers it works

really well even at you know as you're starting out and also just quick Pro tip on a side note when you're starting out with this strategy I know a lot of developers and creators are going do have imposture syndrome of like what the heck do I charge like do I am I worth 25 an hour 100 an hour 500 an hour like no one knows how to charge so here is my step by-step strategy of how I would figure out your hourly rate if you're starting out so to start go completely free just say hey I'm here to provide

value your calendar is going to book up like this and then what's going to happen next is you're going to go oh my gosh I have no more time in the day to do anything I have to bump my hourly rate and we're applying friction so we're going to go free then we're going to book a calendar completely booked booked add friction 25 an hour 50 an hour and then once again our calendar is going to get booked and then we're going to go up again 100 an hour and then our calendar will slowly start booking up

and then whenever your calendar levels at it whatever you're comfortable with maybe two three calls a week whatever works for you that's how you have through the market figured out your hourly rate and it's just crazy as time goes on and more people know about you your hourly rate is just going to keep climbing up and up and up to where you're charging hundreds of dollars and hour and this blew my mind when I started to be like are you cool for a $200 $300 coaching call and people like yeah please let let's go so I just want

you to know limiting beliefs and a lot of impostor syndrome just know everyone has it and that's how I would my step-by-step strategy on figuring out your hourly rate so all right now back to strategic networking and actually specifically what action items you need to be taking inside of pillar number three so first off we need to make it insanely easy for people to reach out to so what I mean is you need to add a clear call to action on all of your social media platforms LinkedIn YouTube everywhere else to say hey I offer help

if you want to talk to me at all click the link down description below so you can add in like a calendly link or you can say hey here's my email shoot me anything I am so happy to help and the reason why is we just want to let people know that we're available for help cuz if you know you don't tell people that they can't just assume that you're here to help so we have to be very explicit and say I am here to help you next what we need to do is like we talked about earlier we need to engage with everyone

and the way I like to think about it is every time someone interacts with me it's another potential opportunity to help but more importantly it's another chance for me to provide value to the world because I know the more I put out there the more that the universe will give back so it is up to us to just give give give give and until you know until we can't give anymore and just to be professional try and respond quickly and really just to go ahead and start the conversation as fast as you can while

they're interested while the lead is hot is kind of the way I like to think about it and then most importantly I see a lot of developers get this wrong and AI creators get this wrong when they start out whenever someone does engage they just respond with a oh cool thanks and that's not how we actually should be engaging with people that we're trying to help we always want to keep things open-ended so you need to ask better questions so instead of just saying thanks cool I appreciate you like the

video no no no we're going to say hey just out of curiosity what are you working on glad you lik the video oh by the way you know what's your biggest challenge with AI or just whatever you were talking about the video just provide a open-ended question back to whoever's engaging with your content just so we can keep the ball rolling make a new friend help out new opportunity it's just we have to ask better questions and then another thing I've kind of harped on this a lot but we want to deliver massive value on every

single call or really every single interaction we have with people the reason why is because the more insight the more strategy and actionable advice you give the more you're going to be seen as an expert and then also it's just going to make you easier to get hired and I used to have a lot of faulty beliefs of just like like I said earlier I'm going to hold in all the good knowledge and like not share it and that's completely wrong give it all away because we're not going to be a gatekeeper of knowledge our whole goal

is to be an implementation expert or an educator expert that's going to help people get to where we're at and then just final thing that I've kind of mentioned a few times now is after we do one of these strategy calls or engagements we always want to say oh by the way I hope you understand everything that we've talked about today and I do believe I could actually help you out with achieving your goal if you're interested here's how I can help and this is where we kind of start to hop over to pillar number four which is

starting to figure out how we actually turn all these conversations that we're having at the very end how do we actually turn this into deals so we can start making money and basically getting compensated for all the value we're putting out into the world so this is exactly what we're going to cover in pillar number four we're going to break down how you turn the content the connections and all the conversations that you're about to have into high paying opportunities so the money just starts flowing in and it

feels so right so let's go ahead and hop over to pillar number four so we can start learning how to put some money in your pockets all right guys welcome to pillar number four which is all about monetization and this is my favorite pillar in the whole course just because this is where everything completely changes and inside of this pillar we're going to be talking about how we're going to you know turn your AI personal brand into a money-making machine I'm going to show you all the different ways

you can make money all the different levels I like I said I'm so excited for you guys to see everything that's about to come come this way all right so the most important thing to note is Everything Changes once the first dollar Stars rolling in because you go from a hobby to a this is a business like it fully makes sense you see how you go end to end of attracting eyeballs to actually making money and this is the section where it all happens and here's the hard truth about it though if you don't have a clear monetization strategy

you're just leaving a ton of money on the table and you actually just might not make money if you don't understand what we're going to be talking about in this section so before diving into the exact ways to make money I think it's important for us to take a step back and understand the three levels of monetization with your AI personal brand and how we're going to start building in leverage to make more and more money as we grow so let's go ahead and dive into to the first one so the first strategy

and first level of monetization inside an AI personal brand is oneon-one so this usually means coaching or freelancing you can do this right out the gate and we'll talk about this much deeper in just a second but just know you can start doing this level level one right out the gate as soon as you launch your AI personal brand next we're going to start going up the leverage chain and we're going to start working on one to many so this is where you're not going to help an individual person you're

going to start working with groups of people and we're going to talk about why this is the next step in just a second and then finally there's the Holy Grail which is the one to Infinity monetization level so this is level three and this is basically where you're going to start creating digital products or SAS Services where every time someone buys it from you there's no additional work so the important part though because we're going to dive deep into each one of these and talk about exactly how you can make money with each one of

these options is just to know these are levels because it takes time to get to the infinite money level whereas the one-on-one coaching you can do immediately when you start your channel so let's go ahead and dive in and actually make some concrete examples so let's start talking oneon-one monetization which is coaching and freelancing so this is 99% most likely where your first dollar is going to come from so this is you going off and coaching and helping other people who are a few step behind you or this is you

freelancing and solving problems for other businesses and this is exactly what I'm helping people do inside of the AI Authority accelerator like I said 8we coaching program by the end of 8 weeks my goal and personal guarantee is you will have one of these opportunities coming in so you're starting to make one of those monies or I'll keep working with you until you get one of these so like I said so confident this is where your first dollars will come from I know I've harped on this a bunch inside of

this master class but it really comes down to understanding a core concept is that every time you are creating content on the internet you're always attracting two audiences so one action gives two results at all times Learners who want your coaching and buyers who want your implementation so this is why level one is all about oneon-one help because this is exactly what our content is basically a lead magnet for it's bringing in these types of people now here's how I recommend getting started with this

one-on-one monetization level one so go ahead pick an hourly rate so like I said I would start at $50 an hour minimum if you're new and then like we talked about in the previous section with our strategic networking we're going to let friction be our guide on what we should charge on an hourly rate so we'll start out $50 an hour and then our calendar will fill up with strategy calls and freelancing opportunities where we're doing work and eventually we're going to say oh my gosh I have no more time hey

man I know we have been working at this rate but I have so much work to do and there's so many opportunities coming my way I have to bump up to $100 an hour or $200 an hour whatever you know whatever the market demands you're just going to keep bumping up your rates because this is I cannot express this enough we are in the perfect opportunity for AI developers and creators the reason why is the demand is here every business every every client every you know student they all want to learn how to

use AI so the supply sorry the demand is here and the supply AKA you as an AI Creator or developer you are in the demand so the demand is small the supply is huge so people are just going to be throwing opportunities your way so you will be amazed how quickly your hourly rate is just going to double and double and just keep going from there because you're a wanted person and people really really need your help so so excited for you guys to actually see this in action cuz it's unreal when you have to start

telling people no and my rate doubled it's just the most mind-blowing thing that'll ever happen all right so now going in the tradition of leveling up eventually what's going to happen is we're going to just run out of time because we're basically going to start charging so much money per hour that no one can afford US totally fine that's just how the market works you know $300 an hour a lot of people can't do that so and order for us to still provide value to people we are going to have to move

to the one to many monetization level where we're going to share our time with multiple people so let me actually go ahead and dive into this so I can explain and like I said this is strictly a forcing function of so many people wanting you you're going to have to transition from a oneon-one to a one to many just where you're sharing your time and splitting it up so people are splitting the cost for your time so it's affordable for them but you're still getting the the big dollars so let's go ahead and dive into this so when you

shift to a one to mini there's really two options so there's High ticket group coaching so think a premium course anywhere from $2 to $10,000 this is where you know you're take you're handholding a few select people on a desired Journey till they get a clear outcome that's option one option two is a low ticket group subscription so think school this is the best way I like to think about it to where hey you know you guys get to hop on premium calls get premium courses that I make just small ticket items and you're just constant

providing a value to a large group of people that are inside of your community so the reason why this is so important is because we're starting to see how money works and how time works together in the one to many model you're trading time you're trading the same amount of time but for a lot more money and you're scaling your impact so this is kind of like the mental model of like oh this is actually how it really works and I want to go ahead and actually give you a few concrete examples of this monetization

strategy working so if you were to go off and create a school community that has 200 members where you're charging $50 a month that is a $10,000 a month business and the part that's so wild is these numbers are not crazy after a 6 months to a year on YouTube building your AI personal brand there's no reason you shouldn't be hitting these numbers cuz basically the answer is are there 200 people on Earth who are interested in what we're doing and we can provide value to them on a month-to-month basis

the answer is yes it's just going to take work to get there and that means we can very easily with an AI personal brand hit $10,000 a month we just can't quit that is the only thing we cannot do don't quit and you will hit this so it's just a wild concept all right so now we're going to keep scaling up the leverage chain and this is where we reach the one to Infinity monetization level where we're starting to sell digital products in SAS and I'm going to explain why this is level three in just a second so once you reach level three

things scale exponentially and here's why instead of selling your time anymore you're going to be selling products that require zero additional effort on your side to you know provide value so what I mean by that is like you're going to create a digital product that people can just buy Around the Clock you're not having to hop on a call you're not having to use your time people are just going to buy it and this is where you're going to start making money while you sleep you know I've built uh full stack

AI marketing courses I've sold digital products in the past and there's I can go aead and tell you there's no better feeling than waking up in the morning and just be like huh while I was sleeping last night I just made a grand or you know hey I built a digital product 6 months ago and oh this weekend I made 500 bucks like there's there's no better feeling than when you reach this level the kicker is it takes time to get here and let me actually go ahead and hop over and show you why so it all comes down to one key fact Size Matters

the size of your audience determines when you can start to do level three of one to Infinity monetization so here's why let's go ahead and look at a small example of a beginner Channel and let's say they have a 100 email subscribers well if they're trying to sell a $200 course with a 1% conversion rate on that email list you have one customer and that one customer is going to pay 200 bucks so you're going to go through the whole process of building out a course spend dozens of hours working on this

and then make 200 bucks not worth it this is strictly a scale problem now let's look at what happens if we sell the same course but we've been in the game longer of building our AI personal brand and we reach 10,000 email subscribers something that's totally doable in your first year of building an AI personal brand so let's look at these numbers well with this the same conversion rate and the only thing that's changed is we've gone from 100 to 10,000 email subscribers we're now going to end up with a 100 people who can buy

our course so the exact same course providing the exact same value is now going to generate $20,000 for us when we do our course launch and what's Wild is these numbers just scale so you keep chugging along building your AI personal brand and now you hit 30,000 email subscribers 50,000 email subscribers well when you hit 50,000 email subscribers in that same course you now just had a sixf fig course launch which is just like mindblowing that this even exists but the key thing here is like we have to do a reality checked like

beginners should not rush into digital products because the math does not work so just keep it in your back pocket know that this is an insanely profitable way to make money and it's just a little bit down the line but I still just want you guys to get excited to see what's possible as you go out and build your AI personal brand now outside of those core monetization streams that I've showed you there's a bunch of other ways you can make money building your AI personal brand so let's go ahead and dive into

them so one and I think it's really overlooked is just a high ping job offer inside the AI space right now if you're a developer it is not uncommon to get paid you know $150,000 Plus in the salary plus you know a ton of money in stocks so this right here if you just build an AI personal brand and you know a few months later it leads to a job like that's a wild you just probably made so much money on your salary that this you know don't sleep on getting a really high paying job next are sponsorships so this is where brands are

going to reach out to you and say hey I really like what you're doing it aligns with what we're trying to do how much does it cost to do a brand deal to where you talk about us in one of your videos you will be amazed at how many companies are going to reach out and ask you to to do this as time goes on you're going to get you know probably close to like 30 a week as your brand grows but you know this is another way to make money outside of that there's YouTube ad Revenue so as you keep posting on

YouTube eventually you're going to hit the requirements to become monetized when this happens YouTube is literally going to pay us to Market ourselves that's such a cheat code the fact that we're going to be proving and sorry posting content that shows we're an expert at what we do people are going to watch it and YouTube's going to pay it for us there's no other platform where you get paid to promote yourself so this one's a like I said complete cheat code and I you know it's awesome to make a

few thousand bucks every month posting content on YouTube and then finally as we' talked about earlier you can do freelancing but eventually you're going to run out of time and what's going to happen is you could go down the agency or matchmaking route in this case in the agency land you're going to keep getting deals thrown at you and you could either be the manager over a few other developers to you know really crank out some awesome products and just make a lot of money between you know you charge

a $100 an hour to the client you Char you pay your developer 60 that 40 bucks in the middle is all yours and completely you know you just make sure the progress goes smoothly for the project or you could play matchmaker where you say hey a project comes in and you go hey I don't know I can't I don't have time to do this however I know Bob Bob is the best builder when it comes to creating this type of stuff and I'd happily refer them to you and you just take a 10 to 20% cut for being the Matchmaker in the middle and you do zero

work but still get paid which is just wild so as you can see there's so many ways to make money with an a personal brand it just it doesn't seem fair it seems like you're cheating but that's just it's such an awesome opportunity and that's why I've been doing this whole course and master class just cuz I want more of you guys to start doing this CU it's completely life-changing now like I said there's unlimited opportunities as you go down this and I want to also talk about one of the biggest benefits of building an AI

personal brand when it comes to monetization and I don't think people fully understand this so one of the best parts about building your personal brand is you're not locked into a single business idea for example if you were to go off and build a SAS application you're going to spend months creating it you're going to go pitch it to the world you know obviously you're going to try and be smart about it but it's going to take time and you're going to pitch in this direction and then if it you know

if it doesn't succeed and take off you have to completely pivot tear all of that down and start over in a New Vertical there's no carrying over like all your res results there's no leverage to add them to the next thing that you do you're always starting completely from Ground Zero building up tearing down building up tearing down and there's no continuation from one project to the next however with an AI personal brand every piece of content that you do stacks on each other over and over and over again and brings you more leads

then with inside your AI personal brand you now have unlimited opportunities to try out all of these different monetization Vehicles so you're going to start doing some coaching then you're going to say hey I've helped a bunch of people you know I've coached a ton of people on this specific problem I'm going to launch a digital course you launch a digital course you help 200 people out you make a good chunk of change and then you're just going to keep posting content bringing in more leads solve another problem another

digital core course start building a SAS app whatever you need to do you're just going to be able to keep stacking on you cuz you are the Cornerstone of the AI personal brand and the business and as long as you keep providing getting new leads in you have unlimited shots on goal of making money in new ways and this is like this right here I don't think enough people understand why building an AI personal brand is the best business opportunity for AI developers in creators strictly for this reason right here cuz the world's

changing so fast and every other business punishes you in a fast changing World cuz you're locked in in this one we're flexible we're agile and we're adapting to the market as things change so this is why I love building an a personal brand so much and I hope you're seeing the power of it now we've gone over we've talked monetization strategy but now we want to talk about scaling it so we so far have gone ahead we've picked your brand positioning we've talked about content we've talked about networking and we've talked about making

money but how do we connect all these systems together to grow exponentially and that's what we're going to be talking about in pillar number five where we're going to start talking about the growth flywheel so you can see how everything connects and honestly just explodes your success so I can't wait to go ahead and hop in and let's go ahead and start talking about pillar number five all right guys welcome to the fifth and final pillar of growing your own AI personal brand which is all about the

growth flywheel and this is where we're going to turn all your systems into exponential growth where we're going to start scaling your audience Authority and income so let's go ahead and dive in to exactly what's happening inside of your growth fly well so at first when you're creating content and growing your AI personal brand it can feel feel slow at start but once you begin to understand how all these different systems work together and compound exponentially it's going to feel like momentum just doesn't stop once your

flywheel starts growing so what's actually happening under the hood inside of your AI personal brand is that you have a three part feedback loop so what's going to happen is your content attention sorry your content engine is going to attract more attention which then fuels networking then as your networking engine starts to grow you're going to build more relationships and those relationships are going to turn into more monetization opportunities and then as you monetize those opportunities you're going to be able to go off and

create more content because you're going to be able to create more tips and tricks guides more how-to guides cuz you've gone off and done real things in the real world and when you go off and create that new content you're going to say oh by the way I implemented this exact solution for paying customers so we now have authority so then that next video hits harder so more subscribers more networking more content and it just keeps going ever and ever and ever but this is how the flywheel works so it's a

three-part feedback loop where every system grows together and just shoots off like a rocket ship with exponential growth so let me go ahead and just give you a more detailed example of the flywheel in action so you can see how one video works to grow everything so here's what a single video can do for you inside of your AI personal brand so you're going to go off and post a YouTube video that shows people how to build an AI tool then inside of that video once it goes live it's going to attract new subscribers and it's going

to spark some DMS with people who are interested doing the same thing that you were doing then you're going to go off and have those strategy calls that we talked about in section number three which with strategic networking you're going to give away all the value that you possibly can and if you potentially could help them even further you're going to say something like oh by the way I actually help coach AI developers do the exact same thing that you're looking to do and you're going to go off

and offer a coaching package of like hey over four different calls strategic calls together I think I can help you build the exact solution you're trying to do help get you there faster then you're going to go off and actually help and do the coaching calls helping them achieve their goal along the way and then what it's going to happen is you're going to see so many lessons learned that people had of with like they didn't know how to do something over here you dropped a tip and trick over here that

they found super helpful that they resonated with and then that is where we start to complete the feedback loop where we're going to go oh okay I now know that you know people a few steps behind me really struggled with this I need to go off and create a video on this and that's going to go off and make new YouTube content it's really going to resonate because if one person had the issue there's probably chance that thousands of people or tens of thousand people have issues with the same thing and we're just going to go ahead and

create the feedback loop which has making awesome content it's going to help with more networking and it's going to help with more monetization so they all work together and just explode and really it comes back to a three-part feedback loop where it just goes content networking monetization and then just repeat and every one of these engines as they grow your whole AI personal brand as a whole grows as well it's just amazing how it all works together and what basically is going to happen is at

first when you're creating your a personal brand like I said it's going to feel slow you're going to be putting out content over and over and over again and what's wild about these platforms like YouTube and Linkedin is they do have an exponential tendency meaning as you grow you grow faster so your first video is going to get you know 100 views 200 views but your fifth video now that YouTube's figured out who you are and you have an audience to already serve content to it's going to start getting

thousands of views then when you have thousands of subscribers and you make another video your new videos are going to get tens of thousands of views and it just literally shoots off like a rocket ship but at first it can feel very slow so this is why I actually want to go ahead and talk about the next point is most creators never reach the point where they feel that exponential growth and things take off and just completely change your life and the reason why is they just quit before their fly will

takes off which hurts me every time I see it happen because I know all the rewards are saved to the people who don't give up so most people they'll post five videos get 10 views and quit it's not their fault they just don't know how to properly create videos and it can be discouraging or they'll have three conversations with people as they're creating their YouTube content and they'll hear I'm not interested and then also quit or they go off and offer coaching once they get a no and quit and it's because it can be very discouraging

if you don't see the bigger picture and just know everything's going to scale and get easier as you grow your AI personal brand but if they had just kept going what would have happened is their content would have started ranking and they would be known as the you know Authority for their specific space their Network would have exploded to where now they're known as the go-to person for a specific topic and opportunities are just just going to come out of the Woodworks left and right and they're

going to have so many ways to make money they can't even keep up with it and then also when it comes to it your you know opportunities just would have like I said started flowing in so the main lesson here is consistency is the price of admission for your growth flywheel you just have to stick to it and if you do the result on the other side like will be absolutely life-changing so I want to go ahead and actually just cover a few things that have happened to me as I've built my own AI personal brand so

you can see exactly what happened when someone who started that had no idea they were doing bought courses along the way to try and figure out how to do it and just promis themselves I'm going to provide as much value to the world as I can and I'm not going to give up those were the only two requirements I had for myself when creating my own AI personal brand so as you can see this is the epitome of building an exponential system like an AI personal brand or to start it's going to look completely flat

because YouTube's trying to figure out who you are we're trying to figure out how to make content that attracts views but eventually things are going to click you're going to understand how to create content you're going to understand understand what your Niche is and then YouTube's going to then go okay here's what this person's capable of doing and I now know who to serve their content to and it's just going to take off like a rocket ship from there so this is my email list and as you can see I started

to figure out what to do on January 2027 uh sorry January the beginning of January 2024 so that was a full year long of me not knowing what to do on YouTube I was all over the place but I just told myself I can't quit and what the whole goal of this master class is to do is that year of just giving up which I call beginner hell I want to shrink it to as to be as small as possible so you start to see results as quick as possible so that's what this master class is for is to shrink it down and then also the AI Authority

accelerator it's to compress it to matter of weeks to compress beginner Health to a matter of weeks so you just start to see everything take off like a rocket ship like Alexandra and Tim have seen like we talked about in the beginning of the video so but the cool part is as you can see once things take off they just shoot like a rocket ship and I want this to happen for you guys as well and you can see over here on YouTube as time goes on you know to start it's just a flatline and it's going to look very sad when you first

see it but just know as time goes on videos from last year are going to feed into your content system you know the longer we stay in the game just everything takes off exponentially there's a reason Einstein said compounding is an eighth interest of the world it's because as time goes on it's our friend and it just takes everything off like a rocket ship so let's actually talk about some Real Results that have happened inside of my AI personal brand so the biggest one new jobs along the way as um the second I started Crea my a

personal brand and letting the world know that I'm a really good software developer when it comes to building AI Solutions job opportunities started happening left and right so within a matter of months I was able to you know go ahead and land a brand new job this completely BW my mind whenever I got to hop on a call with the founder and he said oh my gosh you know we really didn't have like a formal interview cuz he got to see what I was doing on my YouTube channel he's like oh yeah you look like you really know what you're

doing this is awesome and you know it just went from there led to new jobs and new jobs to where eventually right now I'm at CI an absolute dream job literally could not be happier and I was able to only land this job because I've have been showing my capabilities inside of my AI personal brand for the past year leading up to this point and each time along the way it's been more money and more money and more fun honestly so I've just been very very fortunate and on all these companies were absolutely

awesome to work at outside of that there's been so many opportunities for coaching and freelancing so the first year going into it I didn't really know what I was doing inside of YouTube and that's why I'm making this video to help you guys you know save time and a headache there's a reason I have so many gray hairs and basically to you know speedrun this so when it comes to making money so as you can see I actually started getting freelancing opportunities as soon as like 4 months into creating my YouTube brand that was

slight luck slight being in the right place at the right time but that's the whole purpose of building an AI personal brand we it gives us opportunities that we would never realized without and then I started to figure out there's so many people beating on my door for me to help them with their own content or with their own projects because they saw what I was doing on YouTube so I finally was like hey these people want help let's actually start helping them so in the like June is time frame I started

actually coaching people as well which is one of the biggest things we talk about inside the monetization pillar and then over the course of the next 6 months I was just trying to provide and help as many people as I possibly could making money along the way so between freelancing and coaching it was awesome at one point I actually figured out was like hey let's just start selling coaching and bundles like I've recommended to you guys over the course of one weekend when I opened the doors it actually paid enough for my wife and

I to go go to a nice trip to Mexico and that's just like when my brain broke I'm just like oh my gosh there's so much money to be made inside of this so just want you know like the the there is no ceiling to what's possible with building an AI personal brand then from there I decided to go off whenever School launched I thought this was an amazing way to start connecting with a lot more of you guys so I went off and launched my own community and since about you know maybe March is time frame 2024 I've

been able to grow a school Community to almost 6,000 members where I'm able to hop on weekly free coaching calls provide a lot of value to everyone on the call and just you know kind of keep a pulse on what's going on in the world and just provide as much value as I can cuz I'm a firm believer the more value you put out the more good things come to you too so as you can see that's another opportunity that you can do as you go off and launch your AI personal brand and then I've also been able to create

and launch digital products like we talked about in the monetization pillar this has been one of the most fruitful ways to go off and you know just bring in a lot of dollars really fast it blew my mind you know I've never had you know a weekend to where you make like $20,000 plus it just absolutely blew my mind that that was possible and what's wild about this is this was my first major digital product I've learned so many lessons I've learned so many ways how to structure content how to pick a video

topic I've learned so many lessons so I'm confident the next time I do a digital course launch like this it will be twice that maybe three times that because I now better understand how to do this and also going back to our growth flywheel you know as time goes on the audience grows so the same product getting offered to to a bigger audience just means even more money so the kicker here is just don't give up but yeah so inside the AI Authority accelerator this is one of the other things I do want to

be talking with you guys about if you are interested in launching a digital product how to actually go about doing it as well so the one thing I do just want to mention though is you just looked at a snapshot of me over the past two years so none of this happens overnight but it can happen much faster for you guys than it did for me especially if you follow everything that I talked about in today's video so the main thing is once the flywheel starts to spin as you saw earlier it just never stops as long as you don't stop putting

value into the world it never stops and you will grow exponentially and just more opportunities more success comes your way now if you are interested in getting your flywheel to spin faster so you don't have to go through that beginner hell like I said at the beginning of this video I am launching the AI Authority accelerator 8e program that's focused on helping AI developers and creators just like you to build your personal brand and to land your first paid client in just 8 weeks and I'll be helping you every step of the way we are

trying to speedrun success inside the AI Authority accelerator you can take everything that I told you in this video today and go off and absolutely crush it but for those of you who are wanting to maximize and take as much advantage of you can of this AI you know explosive wave that's happening right now in want to get to seeing results as quick as possible definitely recommend checking out the AI Authority accelerator there are only 20 spots in the first cohort and like I said the initial cohort will
