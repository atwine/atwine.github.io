# PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

**Healthcare AI Consultant | Turning Data into Decisions Where Resources Are Scarce**

I solve healthcare data problems that others consider "impossible" in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Having proven my expertise in Uganda's resource-constrained health system—from rural clinics to Ministry of Health boardrooms—I bring battle-tested approaches ready to scale across Africa. I've learned that the most sophisticated AI is worthless if it can't run on unreliable power or be understood by overworked healthcare workers.

**How I Deliver Results:**
- **I build end-to-end AI/ML solutions** that enable **Faster Outbreak Response**, detecting disease patterns weeks earlier than traditional surveillance
- **I create integrated data systems** that optimize resource allocation through real-time dashboards showing exactly where to deploy drugs, staff, and supplies
- **I deliver production-ready solutions** that increase program effectiveness by accurately identifying at-risk populations before crises hit
- **I develop local technical capacity** that strengthens funding proposals with hard evidence of measurable health impact

My clients—governments, UN agencies, and research institutions—engage me when they need someone who understands both cutting-edge AI capabilities and the ground reality of implementing solutions where budgets are tight, infrastructure is unreliable, and stakeholder buy-in determines success.

**I don't do:** One-size-fits-all solutions, academic research that never gets deployed, or systems that collapse when international funding ends.

**Core expertise:** Machine learning for epidemiological surveillance, health systems optimization, real-time decision support dashboards, and transforming fragmented health data into evidence-based policy recommendations.

## EXPERIENCE

### Data Science Specialist | Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI)
**Sept 2021 – Present**

**CLIENT PROBLEM:** Critical health data across Africa was trapped in institutional silos, preventing the large-scale collaborative research needed to tackle continent-wide challenges like pandemics and genetic diseases.

**SOLUTION & IMPACT:** Co-led the data workstream for the **eLwazi Open Data Science Platform**—the central data infrastructure for DS-I Africa, an $88M NIH-funded consortium spanning 38 projects across 22 African countries.

- **Delivered Continental Data Infrastructure:** Led teams that designed and deployed the centralized data platform serving 22 African countries, enabling collaborative health research at unprecedented scale across the continent
- **Enabled $88M Research Ecosystem:** Built the technical foundation supporting 38 active research projects, 7 training programs, and 4 ethics initiatives spanning the entire African continent
- **Pioneered FAIR Data Standards:** Established metadata standards and harmonization protocols now adopted across the largest health data science consortium in Africa's history
