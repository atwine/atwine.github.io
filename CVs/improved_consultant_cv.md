# PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

**Healthcare AI Consultant | Turning Data into Decisions Where Resources Are Scarce**

I solve healthcare data problems that others consider "impossible" in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Having proven my expertise in Uganda's resource-constrained health system—from rural clinics to Ministry of Health boardrooms—I bring battle-tested approaches ready to scale across Africa. I've learned that the most sophisticated AI is worthless if it can't run on unreliable power or be understood by overworked healthcare workers.

**How I Deliver Results:**
- **I build end-to-end AI/ML solutions** that enable **Faster Outbreak Response**, detecting disease patterns weeks earlier than traditional surveillance
- **I create integrated data systems** that optimize resource allocation through real-time dashboards showing exactly where to deploy drugs, staff, and supplies
- **I deliver production-ready solutions** that increase program effectiveness by accurately identifying at-risk populations before crises hit
- **I develop local technical capacity** that strengthens funding proposals with hard evidence of measurable health impact

My clients—governments, UN agencies, and research institutions—engage me when they need someone who understands both cutting-edge AI capabilities and the ground reality of implementing solutions where budgets are tight, infrastructure is unreliable, and stakeholder buy-in determines success.

**I don't do:** One-size-fits-all solutions, academic research that never gets deployed, or systems that collapse when international funding ends.

**Core expertise:** Machine learning for epidemiological surveillance, health systems optimization, real-time decision support dashboards, and transforming fragmented health data into evidence-based policy recommendations.

## EXPERIENCE

### Data Engineer (AMR Project) | Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) - Lacuna Fund
**April 2025 – Present**

**CLIENT PROBLEM:** Uganda's national health system lacked a high-quality, centralized dataset on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), preventing the development of AI models needed to fight the growing threat of drug-resistant infections.

**SOLUTION & IMPACT:** As the lead data engineer on this **$100k Lacuna Fund-awarded project**, my core responsibility is to transform fragmented clinical records into a robust, AI-ready dataset. I am building the foundational data pipeline and testing initial ML models, directly enabling the creation of a national AMR data warehouse that will accelerate research and inform public health policy for the Ministry of Health and WHO.

### Data Science Specialist | Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI)
**Sept 2021 – Present**

**CLIENT PROBLEM:** Critical health data across Africa was trapped in institutional silos, preventing the large-scale collaborative research needed to tackle continent-wide challenges like pandemics and genetic diseases.

**SOLUTION & IMPACT:** Co-led the data workstream for the **eLwazi Open Data Science Platform**—the central data infrastructure for DS-I Africa, an $88M NIH-funded consortium spanning 38 projects across 22 African countries.

- **Delivered Continental Data Infrastructure:** Led teams that designed and deployed the centralized data platform serving 22 African countries, enabling collaborative health research at unprecedented scale across the continent
- **Enabled $88M Research Ecosystem:** Built the technical foundation supporting 38 active research projects, 7 training programs, and 4 ethics initiatives spanning the entire African continent
- **Pioneered FAIR Data Standards:** Established metadata standards and harmonization protocols now adopted across the largest health data science consortium in Africa's history

### Team Lead & Natural Language Specialist | African Center of Excellence (HEAL Project)
**Jul 2023 – Jan 2024**

**CLIENT PROBLEM:** During urgent pandemic situations, frontline health workers were unable to quickly access critical, life-saving guidelines from dense documents, and these materials assumed everyone spoke English. This language barrier created dangerous delays in patient care and introduced bias in application, particularly for those working in local languages.

**SOLUTION & IMPACT:** As the team lead for a diverse group of 8 professionals on the **HEAL project (backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation & Code For Africa)**, I spearheaded the development of an innovative multilingual application that transformed health guideline access.

- **Led Full-Cycle AI Development:** Guided the team through the entire AI lifecycle, including data curation, sophisticated deep learning workflows, LLM tuning and integration, RAP Application, Seq2Seq Modeling and managing multiple APIs (Hugging Face) for a production-ready solution. 
- **Revolutionized Information Access:** Deployed an application that provided instant, accurate health information in both English and Luganda, substantially reducing information retrieval times in crisis scenarios.
- **Empowered Frontline Health Workers:** The tool directly enabled faster, better-informed clinical decisions, revolutionizing how health guidelines were utilized during urgent pandemic situations.
